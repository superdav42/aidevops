# Onboarding Wizard - aidevops Configuration

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Command**: `/onboarding` or `@onboarding`
- **Script**: `~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/onboarding-helper.sh`
- **Settings**: `~/.config/aidevops/settings.json` (canonical config file)
- **Settings helper**: `~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/settings-helper.sh`
- **Purpose**: Interactive wizard to discover, configure, and verify aidevops integrations

**CRITICAL - OpenCode Setup**: NEVER manually write `opencode.json`. Always run:

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/generate-opencode-agents.sh
```

**Settings file**: All onboarding choices are persisted to `~/.config/aidevops/settings.json`. This file is the canonical config — users can edit it directly or via `/onboarding`. Created with documented defaults on first run.

**Workflow**:
1. Welcome & explain aidevops capabilities
2. Ask about user's work/interests for personalized suggestions
3. **Save choices to settings.json** (work type, concepts, orchestration preference)
4. Show current setup status (configured vs needs setup)
5. Guide through setting up selected services
6. Verify configurations work

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Welcome Flow

When invoked, follow this conversation flow:

### Step 1: Introduction (if new user)

Ask if the user would like an explanation of what aidevops does:

```text
Welcome to aidevops setup!

Would you like me to explain what aidevops can help you with? (yes/no)
```

If yes, provide a brief overview:

```text
aidevops gives your AI assistant superpowers for DevOps and infrastructure management.

**Recommended tool:** You should be running this in [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) - the recommended AI coding agent for aidevops. All features, agents, and workflows are designed and tested for OpenCode first. OpenCode supports multiple AI providers (Zen, Anthropic, OpenAI, and more) so you can use whichever model you prefer.

**Capabilities:**

- **Autonomous Orchestration**: Supervisor dispatches AI workers, merges PRs, tracks tasks across repos
- **Infrastructure**: Manage servers across Hetzner, Hostinger, Cloudron, Coolify
- **Domains & DNS**: Purchase domains, manage DNS via Cloudflare, Spaceship, 101domains
- **Git Platforms**: GitHub, GitLab, Gitea with full CLI integration
- **Code Quality**: SonarCloud, Codacy, CodeRabbit, Snyk, Qlty analysis
- **WordPress**: LocalWP development, MainWP fleet management
- **SEO**: Keyword research, SERP analysis, Google Search Console
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright, Stagehand, Chrome DevTools
- **Context Tools**: Augment, Context7, Repomix for AI context

All through natural conversation - just tell me what you need!
```

### Step 2: Check Concept Familiarity

Before diving in, gauge what concepts the user is comfortable with:

```text
To tailor this onboarding, which of these concepts are you already familiar with?

1. Git & version control (commits, branches, pull requests)
2. Terminal/command line basics
3. API keys and authentication
4. Web hosting and servers
5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
6. AI assistants and prompting
7. None of these / I'm new to all of this

Reply with numbers (e.g., "1, 2, 5") or "all" if you're comfortable with everything.
```

**Based on their response, offer to explain unfamiliar concepts:**

If they're unfamiliar with **Git**:

```text
Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your code. Think of it like 
"save points" in a video game - you can always go back. Key concepts:
- **Repository (repo)**: A project folder tracked by Git
- **Commit**: A saved snapshot of your changes
- **Branch**: A parallel version to experiment without affecting the main code
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A proposal to merge your changes into the main branch

aidevops uses Git workflows extensively - but I'll guide you through each step.
```

If they're unfamiliar with **Terminal**:

```text
The terminal (or command line) is a text-based way to control your computer.
Instead of clicking, you type commands. Examples:
- `cd ~/projects` - Go to your projects folder
- `ls` - List files in current folder
- `git status` - Check what's changed in your code

Don't worry - I'll provide the exact commands to run, and explain what each does.
```

If they're unfamiliar with **API keys**:

```text
An API key is like a password that lets software talk to other software.
When you sign up for services like OpenAI or GitHub, they give you a secret key.
You store this key securely, and aidevops uses it to access those services on your behalf.

I'll show you exactly where to get each key and how to store it safely.
```

If they're unfamiliar with **Hosting**:

```text
Hosting is where your website or application lives on the internet.
- **Shared hosting**: Your site shares a server with others (cheap, simple)
- **VPS**: Your own virtual server (more control, more responsibility)
- **PaaS**: Platform that handles servers for you (Vercel, Coolify)

aidevops can help manage servers across multiple providers from one conversation.
```

If they're unfamiliar with **SEO**:

```text
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is how you help people find your website through 
search engines like Google. Key concepts:
- **Keywords**: Words people type when searching (e.g., "best coffee shops near me")
- **SERP**: Search Engine Results Page - what Google shows for a search
- **Ranking**: Your position in search results (higher = more traffic)
- **Backlinks**: Links from other websites to yours (builds authority)
- **Search Console**: Google's tool showing how your site performs in search

aidevops has powerful SEO capabilities:
- Research keywords with volume, difficulty, and competition data
- Analyze SERPs to find ranking opportunities
- Track your site's performance in Google Search Console
- Discover what keywords competitors rank for
- Automate SEO audits and reporting

Even if you're not an SEO expert, I can help you understand and improve your 
site's search visibility through natural conversation.
```

If they're unfamiliar with **AI assistants**:

```text
AI assistants (like me!) can help you code, manage infrastructure, and automate tasks.
Key concepts:
- **Prompt**: What you ask the AI to do
- **Context**: Information the AI needs to help you effectively
- **Agents**: Specialized AI personas for different tasks (SEO, WordPress, etc.)
- **Commands**: Shortcuts that trigger specific workflows (/release, /feature)

The more specific you are, the better I can help. Don't hesitate to ask questions!
```

If they're **new to everything**:

```text
No problem! Everyone starts somewhere. I'll explain each concept as we go.
The key thing to know: aidevops lets you manage complex technical tasks through 
natural conversation. You tell me what you want to accomplish, and I'll handle 
the technical details - explaining each step along the way.

Let's start simple and build up from there.
```

### Step 3: Understand User's Work

Ask what they do or might work on:

```text
What kind of work do you do, or what would you like aidevops to help with?

For example:
1. Web development (WordPress, React, Node.js)
2. DevOps & infrastructure management
3. SEO & content marketing
4. Multiple client/site management
5. Something else (describe it)
```

Based on their answer, highlight relevant services and **save the choice**:

```bash
# Save work type (maps 1=web, 2=devops, 3=seo, 4=wordpress)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/onboarding-helper.sh save-work-type devops
```

Also save the concept familiarity from Step 2:

```bash
# Save familiar concepts (from Step 2 responses)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/onboarding-helper.sh save-concepts 'git,terminal,api-keys'
```

### Step 4: Show Current Status

Run the status check and display results:

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/onboarding-helper.sh status
```

Display in a clear format:

```text
## Your aidevops Setup Status

### Configured & Ready
- GitHub CLI (gh) - authenticated
- OpenAI API - key loaded
- Cloudflare - API token configured

### Needs Setup
- Hetzner Cloud - no API token found
- DataForSEO - credentials not configured
- Google Search Console - not connected

### Optional (based on your interests)
- MainWP - for WordPress fleet management
- Stagehand - for browser automation
```

### Step 5: Guide Setup

Ask which service to set up:

```text
Which service would you like to set up next?

1. Hetzner Cloud (VPS servers)
2. DataForSEO (keyword research)
3. Google Search Console (search analytics)
4. Skip for now

Enter a number or service name:
```

For each service, provide:
1. What it does and why it's useful
2. Link to create account/get API key
3. Step-by-step instructions
4. Command to store the credential
5. Verification that it works

OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant accessible via messaging channels. It complements aidevops by providing always-on, mobile-accessible AI from any messaging platform.

**Full docs**: `@openclaw` or `tools/ai-assistants/openclaw.md`

**To set up OpenClaw during onboarding, follow the guided flow below.**

#### OpenClaw Guided Setup

When a user expresses interest in OpenClaw or mobile AI access, follow this conversation flow:

**Step A: Business Discovery**

Ask about their business and use cases to tailor the setup:

```text
OpenClaw gives you AI accessible from WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal,
iMessage, and more. Before we set it up, tell me a bit about your situation:

1. What does your business/work involve?
2. Do you manage clients or a team?
3. What messaging platforms do you already use?
4. Do you need AI available 24/7, or just when your laptop is open?
5. Do you already have a VPS (Hetzner, Hostinger, etc.)?
```

Based on their answers, suggest specific use cases:

| Business Type | OpenClaw Use Cases |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Agency/freelancer | Client communication bot, project status via WhatsApp, automated reporting |
| SaaS/product | Customer support triage, internal team bot, deployment notifications |
| Content creator | Research assistant via Telegram, voice notes transcription, content scheduling |
| DevOps/sysadmin | Server monitoring alerts, incident response via messaging, cron-triggered health checks |
| Consultant | Meeting prep via voice, quick research from phone, client follow-ups |

**Step B: Deployment Tier Selection**

```text
How would you like to run OpenClaw?

1. Native local - Runs on your laptop (simplest, only available when laptop is on)
2. OrbStack container - Docker on your Mac (isolated, easy to reset)
3. Remote VPS - Always-on server with Tailscale (available 24/7 from any device)

Which sounds right for you?
```

**Step C: Installation (based on tier)**

For **Tier 1 (Native local)**:

```bash
# Install OpenClaw
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

# Run onboarding wizard
openclaw onboard --install-daemon

# Verify
openclaw doctor
```

For **Tier 2 (OrbStack container)**:

```bash
# Ensure OrbStack is running
orb status  # Install with: brew install orbstack

# Clone and set up OpenClaw in Docker
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
./docker-setup.sh

# Access Control UI at http://127.0.0.1:18789/
```

For **Tier 3 (Remote VPS)**:

```text
We'll need to:
1. Provision a VPS (I can help via @hetzner or @hostinger)
2. Install Tailscale on both your machine and the VPS
3. Install OpenClaw on the VPS
4. Configure Tailscale Serve for secure HTTPS access

Shall I walk you through each step?
```

Guide them through:

1. VPS provisioning (use `@hetzner` -- minimum CX22: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
2. Tailscale setup on both machines (see `@tailscale`)
3. OpenClaw install on VPS via SSH over Tailscale
4. Gateway config with Tailscale Serve

**Step D: Channel Setup (Security-First)**

```text
Which messaging channels would you like to connect?

1. WhatsApp (most popular, QR code pairing)
2. Telegram (simple bot token setup)
3. Discord (bot in your server)
4. Slack (workspace app)
5. Signal (privacy-focused)
6. iMessage (via BlueBubbles on macOS)
7. Skip for now (use Control UI only)
```

For each selected channel, guide through setup with security defaults:

- DM policy: `pairing` (default, recommended)
- Group policy: `requireMention: true`
- Allowlists configured before going live

```bash
# After channel setup, verify security
openclaw security audit --fix
```

**Step E: Security Hardening**

Always run the security audit after setup:

```bash
openclaw security audit --deep
```

Walk through each finding and explain:

```text
The security audit checks:
- Who can message your bot (DM policies, allowlists)
- What the bot can do (tool permissions, sandboxing)
- Network exposure (gateway bind, auth tokens)
- File permissions (~/.openclaw/ directory)
- Plugin trust (only load what you explicitly trust)

Any findings marked as warnings should be addressed before going live.
```

**Step F: aidevops vs OpenClaw Decision Tree**

Explain when to use each tool:

```text
Now that OpenClaw is set up, here's when to use each:

aidevops (terminal/IDE):
- Writing and editing code
- Git workflows, PRs, releases
- Server management and deployment
- SEO research and analysis
- Complex multi-file operations

OpenClaw (messaging/voice):
- Quick questions from your phone
- Voice interaction (Talk Mode, Voice Wake)
- Always-on monitoring and alerts
- Client/team communication bots
- Hands-free interaction while mobile

They work together:
- aidevops manages the server OpenClaw runs on
- OpenClaw can trigger aidevops workflows via messages
- Both use the same AI models and can share workspace context
```

## Troubleshooting

### Key not loading

```bash
# Check if credentials.sh is sourced
grep "credentials.sh" ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc

# Source manually
source ~/.config/aidevops/credentials.sh

# Verify
echo "${OPENAI_API_KEY:0:10}..."
```

### MCP not connecting

```bash
# Check MCP status
opencode mcp list

# Diagnose specific MCP
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/mcp-diagnose.sh <name>
```

### Permission denied

```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod 600 ~/.config/aidevops/credentials.sh
chmod 700 ~/.config/aidevops
```

## OpenCode Configuration

**CRITICAL**: When setting up OpenCode with aidevops, ALWAYS use the generator script. NEVER manually write `opencode.json` - the schema is complex and easy to get wrong.

### Correct Setup Method

```bash
# Run the generator script - it handles all schema requirements
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/generate-opencode-agents.sh
```

This script:
- Auto-discovers agents from `~/.aidevops/agents/*.md`
- Configures MCP servers with correct `type: "local"` or `type: "remote"` fields
- Sets up tools as objects (not arrays) with boolean values
- Applies proper loading policies (eager vs lazy MCPs)
- Creates subagent markdown files in `~/.config/opencode/agent/`

### Common Schema Errors (if manually written)

| Error | Wrong | Correct |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `expected record, received array` for tools | `"tools": []` | `"tools": {}` |
| `Invalid input mcp.*` | Missing `type` field | Add `"type": "local"` or `"type": "remote"` |
| `expected boolean, received object` for tools | `"tool_name": {...}` | `"tool_name": true` |

### If OpenCode Won't Start

```bash
# Backup broken config
mv ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json.broken

# Regenerate from scratch
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/generate-opencode-agents.sh

# Restart OpenCode
opencode
```

### Verify Configuration

```bash
# Check config is valid JSON
jq . ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json > /dev/null && echo "Valid JSON"

# List configured agents
jq '.agent | keys' ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json

# List configured MCPs
jq '.mcp | keys' ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
```

## Understanding Agents, Subagents, and Commands

aidevops uses a layered system to give your AI assistant the right context at the right time, without wasting tokens on irrelevant information.

### The Three Layers

| Layer | How to Use | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Main Agents** | Tab key in OpenCode | Switch AI persona with focused capabilities | `Build+`, `SEO`, `WordPress` |
| **Subagents** | `@name` mention | Pull in specialized knowledge on demand | `@hetzner`, `@dataforseo`, `@code-standards` |
| **Commands** | `/name` | Execute specific workflows | `/release`, `/feature`, `/keyword-research` |

### Main Agents (Tab to Switch)

Main agents are complete AI personas with their own tools and focus areas. In OpenCode, press **Tab** to switch between them:

| Agent | Focus | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Build+` | Unified coding agent | Planning, coding, debugging, DevOps |
| `SEO` | Search optimization | Keyword research, SERP analysis, GSC |
| `WordPress` | WordPress ecosystem | Theme/plugin dev, MainWP, LocalWP |

**Build+ intent detection:** Build+ automatically detects your intent:
- "What do you think..." / "How should we..." → Deliberation mode (research, discuss)
- "Implement X" / "Fix Y" / "Add Z" → Execution mode (code changes)

**Specialist subagents:** Use `@aidevops` for framework operations, `@plan-plus` for planning-only mode.

**When to switch agents:** Switch when your task changes domain. Need SEO analysis? Switch to `SEO`. WordPress work? Switch to `WordPress`.

### Subagents (@mention)

Subagents provide specialized knowledge without switching your main agent. Use `@name` to pull in context:

```text
@hetzner list all my servers
@code-standards check this function
@dataforseo research keywords for "ai tools"
```

**How it works:** When you mention a subagent, the AI reads that agent's instructions and gains its specialized knowledge - but stays in your current main agent context.

**Common subagents:**

| Category | Subagents |
|----------|-----------|
| Hosting | `@hetzner`, `@cloudflare`, `@coolify`, `@vercel` |
| Git | `@github-cli`, `@gitlab-cli`, `@gitea-cli` |
| Quality | `@code-standards`, `@codacy`, `@coderabbit`, `@snyk` |
| SEO | `@dataforseo`, `@serper`, `@keyword-research` |
| Context | `@augment-context-engine`, `@context7` |
| WordPress | `@wp-dev`, `@wp-admin`, `@localwp`, `@mainwp` |

### Commands (/slash)

Commands execute specific workflows with predefined steps:

```text
/feature add-user-auth
/release minor
/keyword-research "best ai tools"
```

**How it works:** Commands invoke a workflow that may use multiple tools and follow a specific process. They're action-oriented.

**When to use what:**

| Situation | Use | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Need to switch focus entirely | Main agent (Tab) | Tab → `SEO` |
| Need specialized knowledge | Subagent (@) | `@hetzner help me configure` |
| Need to execute a workflow | Command (/) | `/release minor` |
| General conversation | Just talk | "How do I deploy this?" |

### Progressive Context Loading

aidevops uses **progressive disclosure** - agents only load the context they need:

1. **Root AGENTS.md** loads first (minimal, universal rules)
2. **Main agent** loads when selected (focused capabilities)
3. **Subagents** load on @mention (specialized knowledge)
4. **Commands** load workflow steps (action sequences)

This keeps token usage efficient while giving you access to deep expertise when needed.

### Example Session

```text
# Start in Build+ agent (Tab to select)

> I need to add a new API endpoint for user profiles

# AI helps you plan and code...

> @code-standards check my implementation

# AI reads code-standards subagent, reviews your code

> /pr

# AI runs the PR workflow: linting, auditing, standards check

# Later, need to research keywords for the feature...

# Tab → SEO agent

> /keyword-research "user profile api"

# AI runs keyword research with SEO context
```

## Workflow Features

aidevops isn't just about API integrations - it provides powerful workflow enhancements for any project, including autonomous orchestration that dispatches AI workers, manages PRs across repos, and self-improves.

### Enable Features in Any Project

```bash
cd ~/your-project
aidevops init                         # Enable all features
aidevops init planning                # Enable only planning
aidevops init planning,git-workflow   # Enable specific features
aidevops features                     # List available features
```

**Available features:** `planning`, `git-workflow`, `code-quality`, `time-tracking`

This creates:

- `.aidevops.json` - Configuration with enabled features
- `.agent` symlink → `~/.aidevops/agents/`
- `TODO.md` - Quick task tracking
- `todo/PLANS.md` - Complex execution plans

### Slash Commands

| `(breakdown)` | AI/test/read time | `(ai:2h test:1h)` |
| `started:` | When work began | ISO timestamp |
| `actual:` | Actual time spent | `actual:5h30m` |

## Hands-On Playground

The best way to learn aidevops is by doing. Let's create a playground project to experiment with.

### Step 1: Create Playground Repository

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Git/aidevops-playground
cd ~/Git/aidevops-playground
git init
aidevops init
```

### Step 2: Explore What's Possible

Based on your interests (from earlier in onboarding), here are some ideas:

**For Web Developers:**
- "Create a simple landing page with a contact form"
- "Build a REST API with authentication"
- "Set up a React component library"

**For DevOps Engineers:**
- "Create a deployment script for my servers"
- "Build a monitoring dashboard"
- "Automate SSL certificate renewal"

**For SEO Professionals:**
- "Build a keyword tracking spreadsheet"
- "Create a site audit report generator"
- "Automate competitor analysis"

**For WordPress Developers:**
- "Create a custom plugin skeleton"
- "Build a theme starter template"
- "Automate plugin updates across sites"

### Step 3: Try the Full Workflow

Pick a simple idea and experience the complete workflow:

1. **Plan it**: `/create-prd my-first-feature`
2. **Generate tasks**: `/generate-tasks`
3. **Start development**: `/feature my-first-feature`
4. **Build it**: Work with the AI to implement
5. **Quality check**: `/linters-local` then `/pr`
6. **Release it**: `/release patch`

### Step 4: Personalized Project Ideas

If you're not sure what to build, tell me:
- What problems do you face regularly?
- What repetitive tasks do you wish were automated?
- What tools do you wish existed?

I'll suggest a small project tailored to your needs that we can build together in the playground.

## Repo Sync Configuration

During onboarding, ask the user about their git parent directories for daily repo sync:

```text
Repo sync keeps your local git repos up to date by running git pull --ff-only
daily on repos that are clean and on their default branch.

Where do you keep your git repos? (default: ~/Git)
Enter one or more directories separated by commas, or press Enter for default:
```

If the user provides directories, configure them:

```bash
# Update repos.json with git_parent_dirs
jq --argjson dirs '["~/Git", "~/Projects"]' \
  '. + {git_parent_dirs: $dirs}' \
  ~/.config/aidevops/repos.json > /tmp/repos.json && \
  mv /tmp/repos.json ~/.config/aidevops/repos.json

# Enable the daily scheduler
aidevops repo-sync enable
```

If the user skips, note they can configure later:

```bash
aidevops repo-sync config   # Show configuration instructions
aidevops repo-sync enable   # Enable after configuring
```

## Autonomous Orchestration (Optional)

aidevops can work autonomously — dispatching AI workers, merging PRs, evaluating results, and self-improving. This is opt-in because it uses your API keys.

Ask the user:

```text
aidevops includes autonomous orchestration features that can work in the background:

1. Supervisor pulse    - Dispatches AI workers every 2 min to implement tasks from TODO.md
2. Auto-pickup         - Workers claim #auto-dispatch tasks automatically
3. Cross-repo visibility - Manages tasks, issues, and PRs across all repos in repos.json
4. Strategic review    - Every 4h, an opus-tier review checks queue health, finds stuck
                         chains, identifies root causes, and creates self-improvement tasks
5. Model routing       - Cost-aware dispatch: local > haiku > flash > sonnet > pro > opus
6. Budget tracking     - Per-provider spend limits, subscription-aware routing
7. Session miner       - Daily extraction of learning signals from past sessions
8. Circuit breaker     - Auto-pauses dispatch if workers fail consecutively

These require API keys (Anthropic/OpenAI) and will make API calls on your behalf.

Would you like to enable autonomous orchestration? (yes/no/explain more)
```

If **explain more**:

```text
Here's how it works:

- You add tasks to TODO.md with #auto-dispatch tag
- The supervisor pulse picks them up and launches AI workers
- Workers create branches, implement changes, and open PRs
- The pulse evaluates results, merges passing PRs, and cleans up
- Cross-repo: the supervisor sees tasks, issues, and PRs across all repos in repos.json
- Model routing picks the cheapest model that can handle each task (haiku for simple, opus for complex)
- Budget tracking prevents overspend — set daily limits per provider
- Every 4 hours, an opus-tier strategic review assesses the whole operation:
  finds blocked chains, stale state, idle capacity, and systemic issues
- It creates self-improvement tasks when it finds root causes in the framework

Cost depends on how you access the models:

Subscription plans (recommended for regular use):
- Claude Max ($100-200/mo) or Pro ($20/mo) give generous allowances
- OpenAI Pro ($200/mo) or Plus ($20/mo) for GPT models
- Subscriptions are significantly cheaper than API for sustained daily use
- The pulse, workers, and strategic review all run within your allowance

API billing (for testing and occasional use only):
- Pay-per-token pricing adds up fast with autonomous orchestration
- A busy day with 10+ workers can cost $20-50+ on API billing
- Reserve API keys for testing new providers or burst capacity

Recommendation: use a subscription plan as your primary provider.
Configure API keys as fallback only.

You stay in control — the supervisor only dispatches tasks you've tagged.
```

If **yes**:

```bash
# Save preference and enable the supervisor pulse (every 2 min)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/onboarding-helper.sh save-orchestration true
# See scripts/commands/runners.md for macOS (launchd) and Linux (cron) setup
# The pulse dispatches workers, merges PRs, and manages cross-repo work
```

If **no**:

```bash
# Save preference
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/onboarding-helper.sh save-orchestration false
```

```text
No problem. You can enable it anytime — see scripts/commands/runners.md
for setup instructions (launchd on macOS, cron on Linux).

The strategic review, session miner, and circuit breaker all run as steps
within the pulse — enabling the pulse enables everything.
```

## Settings File

All onboarding choices are saved to `~/.config/aidevops/settings.json`. This is the canonical config file for aidevops — users can edit it directly with any text editor.

**View current settings:**

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/settings-helper.sh list
```

**Edit a setting:**

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/settings-helper.sh set orchestration.enabled true
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/settings-helper.sh set user.work_type devops
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/settings-helper.sh set repo_sync.directories '["~/Git","~/Projects"]'
```

**Export as clean JSON (no docs):**

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/settings-helper.sh json
```

**Reset to defaults:**

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/settings-helper.sh reset
```

Settings sections: `user` (profile), `orchestration` (autonomous workers), `repo_sync` (daily pulls), `quality` (linting), `model_routing` (AI providers), `notifications`, `ui` (display). Each setting has inline documentation — run `settings-helper.sh list` to see descriptions.

## Next Steps After Setup

Once services are configured:

1. **Create your playground**: `mkdir ~/Git/aidevops-playground && cd ~/Git/aidevops-playground && git init && aidevops init`
2. **Test a simple task**: "List my GitHub repos" or "Check my Hetzner servers"
3. **Enable orchestration**: set up the pulse scheduler (see `scripts/commands/runners.md`) — autonomous task dispatch, PR management, cross-repo visibility, and strategic review
4. **Explore agents**: Type `@` to see available agents
5. **Try a workflow**: `/create-prd` → `/generate-tasks` → `/feature` → build → `/release`
6. **Try autonomous mode**: Add `#auto-dispatch` to a TODO.md task and watch the supervisor pick it up
7. **Read the docs**: `@aidevops` for framework guidance
