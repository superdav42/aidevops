## Email Types

### Weekly Newsletter

**Purpose**: Consistent touchpoint that builds trust and keeps audience engaged.

**Structure**:

1. **Subject line** - Curiosity hook or specific value promise (under 50 chars)
2. **Preview text** - Extends the hook (under 90 chars)
3. **Personal opener** (2-3 sentences) - Story, observation, or lesson
4. **Main content** (200-400 words) - One key insight or framework
5. **Content roundup** (3-5 links) - Best content from the week
6. **CTA** - One clear action (reply, click, share)
7. **PS line** - Secondary offer or personal note (highest-read section after subject)

**Cadence**: Weekly, same day and time (consistency builds habit).

**Content Adaptation from Pipeline**:

Story: "Why 95% of AI influencers fail"

Newsletter:
Subject: The 5 mistakes killing AI influencers
Preview: I studied 50 creators for 6 months. Here's what I found.

Hey [Name],

I spent the last 6 months studying 50 AI content creators.

The pattern was brutal: 95% of them are making the same 5 mistakes.

Here's the one that surprised me most:

They chase tools instead of problems.

Nobody cares about your Sora 2 demo. They care about making
better videos faster.

The creators who are actually growing? They research their
audience obsessively, edit AI output ruthlessly, and test
10 variants before committing.

I broke down all 5 mistakes (and what the top 5% do instead)
in this week's video: [link]

### Welcome Sequence (5-7 emails)

**Purpose**: Onboard new subscribers, establish value, and segment by interest.

**Sequence**:

| Email | Timing | Purpose | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| **1** | Immediate | Deliver lead magnet + set expectations | Welcome, download link, what to expect |
| **2** | Day 1 | Quick win | One actionable tip they can use today |
| **3** | Day 3 | Story + credibility | Your journey, results, why you're qualified |
| **4** | Day 5 | Deep value | Best framework or methodology |
| **5** | Day 7 | Social proof | Case study or testimonial |
| **6** | Day 10 | Soft pitch | Introduce paid offering with value framing |
| **7** | Day 14 | Direct pitch | Clear CTA with urgency or bonus |

**Key Principles**:

- Each email should stand alone (not everyone reads sequentially)
- Build trust before asking for anything
- Segment based on clicks (interested in topic A vs topic B)
- Remove non-openers after email 3 (clean list)

### Launch Sequence (5-7 emails)

**Purpose**: Drive sales for a product launch or promotion.

**Sequence**:

| Email | Timing | Purpose | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| **1** | Day -3 | Anticipation | Problem awareness, hint at solution |
| **2** | Day -1 | Story | Your journey solving this problem |
| **3** | Day 0 | Launch | Product reveal, benefits, early-bird offer |
| **4** | Day 1 | Social proof | Testimonials, case studies, results |
| **5** | Day 3 | FAQ | Objection handling, common questions |
| **6** | Day 5 | Scarcity | Deadline reminder, bonus expiring |
| **7** | Day 7 | Last chance | Final call, urgency, FOMO |

### Nurture Sequence

**Purpose**: Long-term relationship building for subscribers who didn't convert.

**Cadence**: Weekly or bi-weekly.

**Content Mix**:

- 60% educational (tips, frameworks, insights)
- 20% story-driven (personal experiences, case studies)
- 10% curated (best resources, tools, articles)
- 10% promotional (soft pitches, offers)

## Subject Line Formulas

### High-Performing Patterns

| Formula | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Number + benefit** | "5 AI tools that save 10 hours/week" | Specific, scannable |
| **Question** | "Are you making this AI content mistake?" | Curiosity gap |
| **How-to** | "How to create 10 videos per day with AI" | Clear value |
| **Contrarian** | "Stop using ChatGPT for content" | Pattern interrupt |
| **Personal** | "I wasted $5k on AI tools (so you don't have to)" | Authenticity |
| **Urgency** | "Last chance: AI content guide (free until Friday)" | Scarcity |
| **Curiosity** | "The AI video secret nobody talks about" | Open loop |
| **Social proof** | "How [Name] went from 0 to 100k with AI content" | Aspirational |

### Subject Line Rules

- Under 50 characters (mobile truncation)
- No ALL CAPS (spam filter trigger)
- No excessive punctuation (!!!, ???)
- Personalization token when available ([Name])
- A/B test 2-3 variants per send
- Preview text extends the hook (not repeats it)

## Email Design

### Mobile-First Layout

- **Width**: 600px maximum
- **Font size**: 16px minimum body, 22px+ headings
- **CTA button**: 44px minimum height, high contrast
- **Images**: Optional, not required for message
- **Single column**: No multi-column layouts on mobile

### Plain Text vs HTML

| Format | Best For | Open Rate Impact |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Plain text** | Personal newsletters, B2B | Higher (feels personal) |
| **Light HTML** | Branded newsletters, B2C | Moderate (professional) |
| **Heavy HTML** | E-commerce, promotions | Lower (feels promotional) |

**Recommendation**: Plain text or light HTML for content-focused newsletters. Heavy HTML only for product launches and promotions.

## Segmentation Strategy

### Segment by Behavior

| Segment | Criteria | Content Strategy |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Engaged** | Opened 3+ of last 5 emails | Full content, early access, premium offers |
| **Casual** | Opened 1-2 of last 5 emails | Re-engagement, best-of content, surveys |
| **Cold** | No opens in 30+ days | Win-back sequence, then remove |
| **Buyers** | Purchased any product | Upsell, loyalty, exclusive content |
| **Clickers** | Clicked specific topic links | Topic-specific content and offers |

### Segment by Interest

Tag subscribers based on:

- Lead magnet downloaded (topic interest)
- Links clicked in newsletters (content preference)
- Survey responses (self-reported interests)
- Purchase history (product category)

## FluentCRM Integration
