# Social - X, LinkedIn, and Reddit Distribution

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Distribute content across social platforms with platform-native tone and format
- **Platforms**: X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit
- **Key Principle**: Same story, different delivery - adapt voice and format per platform
- **Success Metrics**: Engagement rate, shares, profile visits, link clicks

**Critical Rules**:

- **Platform-native tone** - Each platform has distinct expectations; cross-posting identical content underperforms
- **No promotional language on Reddit** - Community-first, value-first, or get downvoted
- **Hook-first on X** - Front-load value in first line (visible before truncation)
- **Professional framing on LinkedIn** - Thought leadership, not sales pitch
- **One idea per post** - Clarity beats comprehensiveness on social

**Platform Tool References**:

- `social-media/bird.md` - X (Twitter) automation and scheduling
- `social-media/linkedin.md` - LinkedIn posting and analytics
- `social-media/reddit.md` - Reddit engagement and community management

## Platform Profiles

### X (Twitter)

**Voice**: Concise, opinionated, personality-forward. Sharpest and most direct of all platforms.

**Formats**:

| Format | Length | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Single post** | 1-2 sentences (under 280 chars) | Hot takes, links, announcements |
| **Thread** | 3-10 posts | Breakdowns, stories, tutorials |
| **Quote post** | 1 sentence + context | Commentary, amplification |
| **Poll** | Question + 2-4 options | Engagement, audience research |

**Thread Structure**:

1. **Hook post** - Bold claim, surprising stat, or question (this determines reach)
2. **Context** - Why this matters, who it's for
3. **Body** - 3-7 posts with one insight each
4. **Summary** - Key takeaway in one sentence
5. **CTA** - Follow, repost, bookmark, or link

**Best Practices**:

- Front-load value - no preamble, no "I've been thinking about..."
- Number thread posts (1/7) for readability
- One idea per post
- Use line breaks for scannability
- Optimal posting: weekdays, 9-11am and 1-3pm local time
- Hashtags: 0-2 maximum (X penalizes hashtag spam)

Story: "Why 95% of AI influencers fail"

X Thread (7 posts):
1/ 95% of AI influencers will fail this year. Not because the tech is bad. Because they're making the same 5 mistakes.
2/ Mistake 1: They chase tools, not problems. Nobody cares about your Sora 2 demo. They care about solving their video production bottleneck.
3/ Mistake 2: They post AI-generated content without editing. Your audience can tell. They always can.
...
7/ The 5% who succeed? They research first, create second, and optimize third. That's the entire playbook. Follow for the deep dive.
```

### LinkedIn

**Voice**: Professional, authoritative, thought-leadership. More formal than X, less formal than whitepaper.

**Formats**:

| Format | Length | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Text post** | 150-300 words | Opinions, lessons, quick insights |
| **Article** | 800-2,000 words | Deep dives, case studies |
| **Carousel** | 8-12 slides, 20-40 words each | Frameworks, step-by-step guides |
| **Document** | 5-15 pages | Reports, playbooks |
| **Poll** | Question + 4 options | Engagement, market research |

**Post Structure**:

1. **Hook line** - Question, bold claim, or surprising stat (visible before "see more")
2. **Line break** - Forces "see more" click
3. **Body** - One thought per line, liberal line breaks
4. **Insight** - Key takeaway or lesson
5. **CTA** - Question to drive comments, or link

**Best Practices**:

- Open with a hook that stops the scroll
- Use line breaks liberally - one thought per line
- End with a question or clear CTA to drive engagement
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant ones, placed at the end
- Avoid: corporate jargon, "excited to announce", empty self-promotion
- Optimal posting: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am local time
- Personal stories outperform corporate announcements

Story: "Why 95% of AI influencers fail"

LinkedIn Post:
Most AI influencers will fail this year.

Not because the technology isn't good enough.

Because they're solving the wrong problem.

I spent 6 months studying the top 50 AI content creators.
The pattern was clear:

The ones who succeed don't talk about tools.
They talk about outcomes.

Here's what separates the 5% who make it:

1. They research their audience before creating content
2. They edit AI output ruthlessly (your audience can always tell)
3. They optimize based on data, not gut feeling
4. They build systems, not one-off posts
5. They solve real problems, not demo features

The AI content gold rush is real.
But the winners won't be the ones with the best tools.

They'll be the ones who understand their audience best.

### Reddit

**Voice**: Community-native, authentic, anti-promotional. Reddit users detect and punish marketing instantly.

**Formats**:

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Text post** | Discussions, questions, sharing experiences |
| **Link post** | Sharing resources (with genuine context) |
| **Comment** | Adding value to existing discussions |
| **AMA** | Building authority in a niche |

**Subreddit Strategy**:

1. **Identify target subreddits** - Where does your audience discuss your topic?
2. **Lurk first** - Understand community norms, rules, and tone
3. **Add value** - Answer questions, share experiences, provide resources
4. **Build karma** - Genuine participation before any self-promotion
5. **Share content** - Only when genuinely relevant and valuable

**Best Practices**:

- **Never** lead with self-promotion - provide value first
- Write like a community member, not a marketer
- Share personal experience and lessons learned
- Use the subreddit's language and conventions
- Respond to comments on your posts
- Follow each subreddit's self-promotion rules (typically 10:1 ratio)
- Optimal posting: weekday mornings (US time zones)

Story: "Why 95% of AI influencers fail"

Reddit Post (r/artificial):
Title: After studying 50 AI content creators for 6 months, here's what separates the ones who make it

I've been tracking AI content creators since mid-2025. Not as a fan - as someone trying to understand what actually works.

The short version: most of them are doing the same thing wrong.

They demo tools instead of solving problems. Their audience doesn't care about Sora 2 Pro's new features. They care about making better videos faster.

The creators who are actually growing:
- Research their audience obsessively (Reddit is a goldmine for this)
- Edit AI output until it doesn't feel like AI
- Test 10 variants before committing to one approach
- Build repeatable systems instead of one-off viral attempts

Happy to share more details on the research methodology if anyone's interested.

## Analytics and Optimization

### Key Metrics per Platform

### A/B Testing (from `content/optimization.md`)
