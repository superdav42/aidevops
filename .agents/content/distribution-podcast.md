# Podcast - Audio-First Distribution

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Distribute content as podcast episodes with show notes and syndication
- **Formats**: Solo episodes, interviews, repurposed video audio, mini-episodes
- **Key Principle**: Audio-first design - content must work without visuals
- **Success Metrics**: Downloads, listen-through rate, subscriber growth, reviews

**Critical Rules**:

- **Audio quality is non-negotiable** - Bad audio = instant skip (use voice pipeline)
- **Hook in first 30 seconds** - State the value proposition immediately
- **Show notes are SEO content** - Treat them as blog posts with timestamps
- **Consistency beats quality** - Regular schedule matters more than production value
- **Repurpose everything** - Every podcast episode feeds 5+ other channels

**Voice Pipeline** (from `content/production-audio.md`):

1. CapCut AI voice cleanup (normalize accents, remove artifacts)
2. ElevenLabs transformation (voice cloning or style transfer)
3. NEVER publish raw AI audio - always process through the pipeline

## Episode Types

### Solo Episode (15-30 minutes)

**Purpose**: Share expertise, frameworks, and insights directly.

**Structure**:

1. **Cold open** (0-30s) - Hook with the episode's key insight or bold claim
2. **Intro** (30s-1m) - Show name, episode number, what the listener will learn
3. **Context** (1-3m) - Why this topic matters now, who it's for
4. **Body** (10-20m) - 3-5 main points with examples and stories
5. **Summary** (1-2m) - Key takeaways in bullet form
6. **CTA** (30s) - Subscribe, review, visit link, join community

**Content Adaptation from Pipeline**:

```text
Story: "Why 95% of AI influencers fail"

Solo Episode Outline:
[0:00] "95% of AI influencers will fail this year. I spent 6 months
       studying why. Here are the 5 mistakes they're all making."

[0:30] "Welcome to [Show Name], episode [X]. I'm [Name], and today
       we're breaking down what separates the 5% who succeed in AI
       content from the 95% who don't."

[1:00] Context: The AI content gold rush, why everyone's jumping in,
       and why most will fail.

[3:00] Mistake 1: Chasing tools instead of problems
       - Example: Sora 2 demos vs solving video production pain
       - What the top creators do instead

[8:00] Mistake 2: Publishing unedited AI content
       - Why audiences can always tell
       - The editing workflow that works

[13:00] Mistake 3: Ignoring audience research
        - The 30-Minute Expert Method
        - Reddit as a goldmine for audience insights

[18:00] Mistake 4: No testing or optimization
        - The 10-variant rule
        - A/B testing discipline

[22:00] Mistake 5: One-off posts instead of systems
        - The multi-media multiplier
        - Building repeatable content systems

[26:00] Summary: "If you take one thing from this episode..."

[27:00] CTA: "Subscribe, leave a review, and check the show notes
        for the full framework breakdown."
```

- Send guest a brief with topic areas (not exact questions)

### Repurposed Video Episode

**Purpose**: Extract audio from YouTube videos for podcast distribution.

**Workflow**:

3. **CTA** (15-30s) - Quick subscribe reminder

**Best For**: Daily or 3x/week publishing cadence, building consistency.

## Show Notes

**Structure**:

1. **Title** - Episode number + keyword-optimized title
