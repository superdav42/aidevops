# Character Production

AI-powered character design and consistency management for video content, brand personas, and multi-scene productions using facial engineering, character bibles, and cross-platform character reuse.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Create and maintain consistent characters across AI-generated content
- **Primary Techniques**: Facial engineering framework, character bibles, Sora 2 Cameos, Veo 3.1 Ingredients, Nanobanana character JSON
- **Key Principle**: "Model recency arbitrage" — always use latest-gen models, older outputs get recognized as AI faster
- **Related**: `content/production-image.md`, `content/production-video.md`, `tools/vision/image-generation.md`

**When to Use**: Creating brand mascots, recurring video characters, influencer personas, character-driven content series, or any production requiring visual consistency across multiple outputs.

## Veo 3.1 Ingredients Workflow

**ALWAYS use Ingredients-to-Video** (upload face as ingredient, reference in prompt).
**NEVER use Frame-to-Video** (produces grainy, yellow-tinted, inconsistent output).

### Reference Face Generation

Generate with Nanobanana Pro or Midjourney:

```json
{
  "subject": "[Paste facial engineering description]",
  "concept": "Professional character reference portrait",
  "composition": {"framing": "close-up", "angle": "eye-level", "focal_point": "eyes", "depth_of_field": "shallow"},
  "lighting": {"type": "studio", "direction": "three-point", "quality": "soft diffused", "color_temperature": "neutral (5500K)"},
  "style": {"aesthetic": "photorealistic", "texture": "smooth"},
  "technical": {"resolution": "4K", "aspect_ratio": "1:1"}
}
```

### Veo 3.1 Prompt Structure

```text
INGREDIENTS:
- Face: [character-name]-face

[Standard 7-component prompt — see tools/video/video-prompt-design.md]
Subject (use ingredient [character-name]-face) | Action | Context | Camera Movement | Composition | Lighting (complement ingredient face lighting) | Audio

Negative: different face, face swap, altered features, inconsistent appearance
```

## Nanobanana Character JSON Templates

Includes brand identity fields (color palette, lighting, camera) for cross-output consistency:

```json
{
  "template_name": "character-[name]-base",
  "template_version": "1.0",
  "character_id": "unique_identifier",
  "subject_base": "[Facial engineering description - 2-3 sentences]",
  "subject_variables": {
    "expression": "[neutral/smiling/serious/surprised]",
    "pose": "[standing/sitting/walking/gesturing]",
    "clothing": "[Specific outfit from character bible]",
    "context": "[Environment or activity]"
  },
  "composition": {"framing": "[variable]", "angle": "eye-level", "rule_of_thirds": true, "focal_point": "eyes", "depth_of_field": "shallow"},
  "lighting": {"type": "[brand consistent]", "direction": "[brand consistent]", "quality": "[brand consistent]", "color_temperature": "[brand consistent]"},
  "color": {"palette": ["#HEX1", "#HEX2", "#HEX3"], "dominant": "[brand primary]", "accent": "[brand accent]"},
  "style": {"aesthetic": "[brand aesthetic]", "texture": "[brand texture]", "post_processing": "[brand post-processing]"},
  "technical": {"camera": "[consistent model]", "lens": "[consistent lens]", "settings": "[consistent settings]", "resolution": "4K", "aspect_ratio": "[variable]"},
  "negative": "different face, altered features, inconsistent appearance, blurry, low quality, distorted, watermark"
}
```

Template variants: `templates/characters/[name]/` — `base.json`, `thumbnail-excited.json`, `thumbnail-serious.json`, `social-casual.json`, `professional-headshot.json`, `action-teaching.json`

## Brand Identity Template

Define once, reference from all character templates to ensure visual constants (lighting direction, color temperature, mood, post-processing LUT, camera model/lens/settings):

```json
{
  "brand_name": "[Your Brand]",
  "visual_identity": {
    "color_palette": {"primary": "#HEX", "secondary": "#HEX", "accent": "#HEX"},
    "lighting": {"type": "natural", "quality": "soft diffused", "color_temperature": "warm (4500K)", "mood": "bright and airy"},
    "post_processing": {"color_grade": "Warm with slight orange/teal split", "film_grain": "Subtle (10%)", "contrast": "Medium (1.2x)", "saturation": "Slightly boosted (1.1x)"},
    "camera_aesthetic": {"camera": "Sony A7IV", "lens": "50mm f/1.8", "settings": "f/2.8, 1/200s, ISO 400"}
  }
}
```

## Model Recency Arbitrage

**Always use latest-generation AI models.** Audience AI-detection timeline: 0-3 months (cutting-edge) → 3-6 months (patterns recognizable) → 6-12 months ("AI look" obvious) → 12+ months (dated).

**Current generation (2026)**: Sora 2 Pro, Veo 3.1, Nanobanana Pro, FLUX.1 Pro, Midjourney v7

**On model upgrade**: Test character consistency → update prompts → regenerate reference images, Cameos, Ingredients, and JSON templates → update brand post-processing → document quirks → archive old outputs.

## Character Consistency Verification

### Checklist

- **Facial Features**: face shape, eye shape/color/spacing, nose, mouth/lips, skin tone/texture, hair, distinctive features
- **Body & Wardrobe**: body type/build, height proportions, wardrobe, colors, accessories, posture
- **Expression & Behavior**: expressions match personality, body language, gestures, eye contact
- **Brand Alignment**: lighting, color grading, post-processing, overall aesthetic

### Cross-Content Consistency

| Context | Facial features | Wardrobe | Lighting | Camera |
|---------|----------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Same scene/series | Exact match | Same | Same | Same |
| Different scenes/episodes | Consistent | Variations within style | Varies by location, maintain brand mood | Consistent |
| Different platforms | Always consistent | Adapted to platform norms | Adapted to platform norms | Format adapted |

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Face changes between generations | More detailed facial engineering; hex codes; use Veo 3.1 Ingredients |
| Wardrobe inconsistency | Hex codes; list exact items; use Nanobanana JSON; composite onto scenes |
| Expression doesn't match personality | Include personality in prompt; specify exact emotion; reference bible |
| Lighting/style inconsistency | Brand identity template; same lighting params; consistent LUT; batch generate |

## Multi-Character Management

**Differentiation Matrix** (example):

| Character | Face Shape | Eye Color | Hair | Wardrobe | Personality | Voice |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Alex | Oval | Brown | Black | Minimalist | Analytical | Calm |
| Sarah | Heart | Green | Blonde | Colorful | Energetic | Upbeat |
| Marcus | Square | Blue | Brown | Professional | Authoritative | Deep |

Rules: distinct visual markers per character; consistent relationship dynamics; complementary (not overlapping) expertise; same brand identity across all.

## Character Evolution

**Can change**: wardrobe, hair style, expressions, expertise, confidence
**Must stay consistent**: facial bone structure, eye color/shape, skin tone, core personality, voice, distinctive features

Track changes in a version log: Version | Changes | Reason | Audience Response.

## Tools & Resources

**Image**: Nanobanana Pro (JSON prompts), Midjourney (objects/environments), Freepik (character scenes), Seedream 4 (4K refinement), Ideogram (face swap, text)
**Video**: Sora 2 Pro (UGC-style), Veo 3.1 (cinematic, character-consistent), Higgsfield (multi-model)
**Voice**: ElevenLabs (cloning/transformation), CapCut (AI voice cleanup — use BEFORE ElevenLabs)

**Related docs**: `content/production-image.md`, `content/production-video.md`, `content/production-audio.md`, `tools/vision/image-generation.md`, `tools/video/video-prompt-design.md`

## Workflow Summary

**New Character**: Define purpose → facial engineering → character bible → reference assets → JSON templates → test consistency → document in library

**Existing Character**: Reference bible → load template (Nanobanana/Sora/Veo) → adapt → generate → verify consistency → publish → document evolution

**Maintain Consistency**: Regular audits → update bible on changes → upgrade AI models → regenerate assets → monitor feedback → iterate

**Content Pipeline**: Research (`content/research.md`) → Story (`content/story.md`) → Production (writing, image, video, audio) → Distribution (`content/distribution-*.md`) → Optimization (`content/optimization.md`)
