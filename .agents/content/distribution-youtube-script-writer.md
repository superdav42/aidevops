# YouTube Script Writer

Generate YouTube video scripts optimized for audience retention. Supports structured outlines, full scripts with pattern interrupts, hook generation, and remix mode (transform competitor videos into unique content).

## Pre-flight Questions

Before writing a video script, work through:

1. What is the single takeaway — and does every section of the script serve it?
2. Why would someone watch past 30 seconds — what tension or promise holds them?
3. What does the viewer already know — where does this video meet them?
4. What would make this indistinguishable from the last 10 videos on this topic — and how do we avoid that?

## When to Use

Read this subagent when the user wants to:

- Write a YouTube video script from a topic/outline
- Generate hooks for the first 30 seconds
- Create a script outline with retention curve awareness
- Remix a competitor's video into a unique script
- Apply storytelling frameworks (AIDA, Hero's Journey, etc.)
- Optimize an existing script for better retention

## Script Structure

Every YouTube script follows this retention-optimized structure:

```text
HOOK (0-30 seconds)
  Pattern interrupt + promise + credibility
  Goal: Stop the scroll, prevent click-away

INTRO (30-60 seconds)
  Context + roadmap + stakes
  Goal: Commit viewer to watching the full video

BODY (bulk of video)
  Section 1: [Topic point] + pattern interrupt
  Section 2: [Topic point] + pattern interrupt
  Section 3: [Topic point] + pattern interrupt
  ...
  Goal: Deliver value while maintaining curiosity

CLIMAX (near end)
  Payoff the hook's promise
  Goal: Satisfy the viewer's initial curiosity

CTA (final 30 seconds)
  Subscribe + next video + comment prompt
  Goal: Convert viewer into subscriber
```

### Pattern Interrupts

Insert every 2-3 minutes to reset attention:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Curiosity gap** | "But here's where it gets weird..." |
| **Story pivot** | "That's what I thought too, until..." |
| **Direct address** | "Now you might be thinking..." |
| **Visual change** | "[B-roll / graphic / screen change]" |
| **Tease ahead** | "And the third one is the one nobody expects..." |
| **Reframe** | "But forget everything I just said, because..." |

## Hook Formulas

The hook is the most critical part. Use these proven formulas:

### 1. Bold Claim

> "[Surprising statement that challenges assumptions]"
> Example: "This $5 tool outperforms every $500 alternative I've tested."

### 2. Question Hook

> "[Question that the viewer desperately wants answered]"
> Example: "Why do 90% of YouTube channels never reach 1,000 subscribers?"

### 3. Story Hook

> "[Drop into the middle of a compelling story]"
> Example: "Three months ago, I made a video that got 47 views. Last week, it hit 2 million."

### 4. Contrarian Hook

> "[Statement that goes against popular belief]"
> Example: "Everything you've been told about YouTube SEO is wrong."

### 5. Result Hook

> "[Show the end result, then explain how]"
> Example: "This channel went from 0 to 100K subscribers in 6 months. Here's exactly how."

### 6. Problem-Agitate Hook

> "[Name a pain point, then make it worse]"
> Example: "Your YouTube thumbnails are costing you views. And the fix isn't what you think."

### 7. Curiosity Gap Hook

> "[Reveal partial information that demands completion]"
> Example: "There's one setting in YouTube Studio that 95% of creators never touch. It changed everything for me."

## Storytelling Frameworks

Choose based on content type:

### AIDA (Best for: product reviews, tutorials)

1. **Attention**: Hook with the problem or result
2. **Interest**: Why this matters to the viewer
3. **Desire**: Show the solution working
4. **Action**: CTA (subscribe, try it, comment)

### Three-Act Structure (Best for: documentaries, deep dives)

1. **Setup**: Introduce the topic, establish stakes
2. **Confrontation**: Present the conflict/challenge/mystery
3. **Resolution**: Deliver the answer/solution/revelation

### Hero's Journey (Best for: personal stories, transformations)

1. **Ordinary world**: Where you/subject started
2. **Call to adventure**: The challenge that appeared
3. **Trials**: What was tried, what failed
4. **Transformation**: The breakthrough moment
5. **Return**: What was learned, how it applies to viewer

### Problem-Solution-Result (Best for: how-to, educational)

1. **Problem**: What's broken/missing/painful
2. **Failed approaches**: What doesn't work (and why)
3. **Solution**: The method that works
4. **Proof**: Evidence it works (data, examples, demos)
5. **Implementation**: Step-by-step for the viewer

### Listicle with Stakes (Best for: "Top X" videos)

1. **Hook**: Why this list matters
2. **Items N through 2**: Build anticipation (save best for last)
3. **Item 1**: The most impactful/surprising entry
4. **Synthesis**: What the list reveals about the bigger picture

## Workflow: Generate a Script

### Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
# Recall channel voice and audience from memory
memory-helper.sh recall --namespace youtube "channel voice"
memory-helper.sh recall --namespace youtube "audience"

# Get topic research
memory-helper.sh recall --namespace youtube-topics "[topic]"

# Get competitor scripts on this topic (transcripts)
youtube-helper.sh transcript COMPETITOR_VIDEO_ID
```

### Step 2: Choose Framework

Match the framework to the content type:

| Content Type | Best Framework |
|-------------|---------------|
| Product review | AIDA |
| Tutorial / how-to | Problem-Solution-Result |
| Documentary / explainer | Three-Act Structure |
| Personal story | Hero's Journey |
| List / roundup | Listicle with Stakes |
| News / update | Inverted Pyramid (most important first) |
| Comparison | Side-by-side with verdict |

### Step 3: Generate the Script

**Prompt pattern for script generation**:

> Write a YouTube video script for the topic: [topic]
>
> **Channel voice**: [from memory — formal/casual, humor style, expertise level]
> **Target audience**: [from memory — who they are, what they care about]
> **Framework**: [chosen framework]
> **Target length**: [X minutes / Y words]
> **Primary keyword**: [from topic research]
>
> Requirements:
> 1. Hook must use [formula type] format
> 2. Include pattern interrupts every 2-3 minutes
> 3. Include [VISUAL CUE] markers for B-roll/graphics
> 4. Include [TIMESTAMP] markers for YouTube chapters
> 5. End with a specific CTA that relates to the content
>
> Competitor angles to AVOID (already covered):
> - [angle 1 from topic research]
> - [angle 2 from topic research]
>
> Our unique angle: [from topic research]

### Step 4: Review and Refine

Check the script against these retention signals:

| Checkpoint | What to Verify |
|-----------|---------------|
| First 5 seconds | Does it stop the scroll? |
| First 30 seconds | Is the hook complete with promise + credibility? |
| 60-second mark | Does the viewer know what they'll get? |
| Every 2-3 minutes | Is there a pattern interrupt? |
| Midpoint | Is there a "but wait" moment to re-engage? |
| Before CTA | Was the hook's promise fulfilled? |
| CTA | Is it specific and content-related (not generic)? |

## Workflow: Remix Mode

Transform a competitor's successful video into a unique script with your voice and angle.

### Step 1: Extract the Source Structure

```bash
# Get the full transcript
youtube-helper.sh transcript VIDEO_ID > /tmp/source_transcript.txt

# Get video metadata
youtube-helper.sh video VIDEO_ID
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure

**Prompt pattern**:
> Analyze this transcript and extract:
> 1. The hook formula used (first 30 seconds)
> 2. The storytelling framework
> 3. Key points covered (in order)
> 4. Pattern interrupts used
> 5. The CTA approach
> 6. What made this video successful (based on [X views])
>
> [paste transcript]

### Step 3: Remix with New Angle

**Prompt pattern**:
> Using the structure extracted above, write a NEW script that:
> 1. Covers the SAME topic but from [new angle]
> 2. Uses MY channel voice: [description]
> 3. Adds [new information/perspective] not in the original
> 4. Keeps the structural elements that made the original successful
> 5. Is clearly distinct — no copied phrases or examples
>
> The goal is to learn from what worked, not to copy.

### Remix Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Same topic, new angle** | Cover the same subject from a different perspective |
| **Same structure, new topic** | Apply the successful format to a different subject |
| **Update** | Take an older video's topic and cover what's changed |
| **Response** | Create a response/reaction that adds your expertise |
| **Deep dive** | Take one point from a broad video and go deeper |
