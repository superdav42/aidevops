# AI Video Production

<!-- CLASSIFICATION: Domain reference material (not agent operational instructions).
     This file documents video production techniques, API workflows, prompt templates,
     and tool comparisons. Imperative language ("ALWAYS use ingredients-to-video",
     "NEVER frame-to-video") describes domain best practices, not agent behaviour
     directives. The single-source-of-truth policy (AGENTS.md) governs agent routing,
     tool access, and behavioural rules — not domain knowledge libraries like this.
     See AGENTS.md Domain Index: Content/Video/Voice for the authoritative pointer. -->

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Generate professional AI video content using Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and Higgsfield
- **Primary Models**: Sora 2 Pro (UGC/authentic), Veo 3.1 (cinematic/character-consistent)
- **Key Technique**: Seed bracketing (15% → 70%+ success rate)
- **Production Value Threshold**: <$10k = Sora 2, >$100k = Veo 3.1

**When to Use**: Read this when generating AI video content, planning video production workflows, or optimizing video generation quality.

**Model Selection Decision Tree**:

```text
Content Type?
├─ UGC/Authentic/Social (<$10k production value)
│  └─ Sora 2 Pro
├─ Cinematic/Commercial (>$100k production value)
│  └─ Veo 3.1
└─ Character-Consistent Series
   └─ Veo 3.1 (with Ingredients)
```

**Critical Techniques**:
- Seed bracketing: Test seeds 1000-1010, score outputs, iterate
- Content-type seed ranges: people 1000-1999, action 2000-2999, landscape 3000-3999, product 4000-4999, YouTube 2000-3000
- 2-Track production: objects/environments (Midjourney→VEO) vs characters (Freepik→Seedream→VEO)
- Veo 3.1: ALWAYS use ingredients-to-video, NEVER frame-to-video (produces grainy yellow output)

### Ingredients-to-Video Workflow (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Frame-to-video produces grainy, yellow-tinted output. Always use ingredients.

**Step 1: Prepare Ingredients**

Upload reference assets as "ingredients" (not as frame-to-video input):
- Character faces (for consistency across scenes)
- Product images (for accurate representation)
- Brand assets (logos, colors, textures)
- Style references (lighting, composition examples)

**Step 2: Create Ingredient Library**

```bash
# Via Higgsfield API
curl -X POST 'https://platform.higgsfield.ai/api/characters' \
  --header 'hf-api-key: {api-key}' \
  --header 'hf-secret: {secret}' \
  --form 'photo=@/path/to/character_face.jpg'

# Response includes ingredient ID
{
  "id": "3eb3ad49-775d-40bd-b5e5-38b105108780",
  "photo_url": "https://cdn.higgsfield.ai/characters/photo_123.jpg"
}
```

**Step 3: Generate with Ingredients**

```json
{
  "params": {
    "prompt": "[Full VEO 7-component prompt]",
    "custom_reference_id": "3eb3ad49-775d-40bd-b5e5-38b105108780",
    "custom_reference_strength": 0.9,
    "model": "veo-3.1-pro"
  }
}
```

**Ingredient Strength Guidelines**:
- 0.7-0.8: Subtle influence, allows creative variation
- 0.9-1.0: Strong consistency, minimal deviation
- Character faces: 0.9+
- Products: 0.95+
- Style references: 0.7-0.8

### Example: Cinematic Commercial

```text
[1. TECHNICAL SPECS]
Camera: ARRI Alexa LF, 35mm anamorphic lens, 8K, 24fps, 2.39:1 aspect ratio
Lighting: Golden hour natural light, 3200K color temperature, warm cinematic mood
Movement: Slow dolly in (2 seconds), smooth gimbal stabilization

[2. SUBJECT]
Character: [Reference ingredient ID: 3eb3ad49-775d-40bd-b5e5-38b105108780]
Woman, late 20s, Mediterranean features, shoulder-length dark brown hair with natural wave, hazel eyes, confident posture, wearing tailored charcoal blazer, minimal jewelry (small gold earrings), professional yet approachable demeanor

[3. ACTION]
Primary: Character walks slowly toward camera through modern office lobby, maintaining eye contact
Secondary: Slight smile forming at 2-second mark, natural arm swing, confident stride
Timing: Deliberate pacing, 3 steps total over 5 seconds, pause at 4-second mark

[4. CONTEXT]
Environment: Contemporary glass-walled office lobby, floor-to-ceiling windows, city skyline visible, golden hour sunlight streaming through, polished concrete floors reflecting light
Props: Minimalist reception desk (background), potted plants (midground), architectural columns (framing)
Atmosphere: Aspirational, professional, warm, inviting

[5. CAMERA MOVEMENT]
Type: Dolly in
Path: Starts at medium shot (MS), ends at medium close-up (MCU), smooth 0.5m forward movement over 5 seconds
Motivation: Creates intimacy, draws viewer into character's confidence

[6. COMPOSITION]
Framing: Rule of thirds, character positioned on right third, leading lines from floor tiles guide eye to subject
Depth: Foreground (character), midground (lobby elements), background (windows/skyline with bokeh)
Visual Hierarchy: Character's face (primary), blazer details (secondary), environment (tertiary)

[7. AUDIO]
Dialogue: None (visual storytelling)
Ambient: Quiet office atmosphere, distant keyboard typing, soft HVAC hum, -25 LUFS
SFX: Footsteps on polished concrete (subtle, 0.5s intervals), clothing rustle, -20 LUFS
Music: Minimal piano score, hopeful progression, 80 BPM, strings enter at 3s, -18 LUFS
```

## Seed Bracketing Method

Seed bracketing increases success rate from 15% to 70%+ by systematically testing seed ranges and scoring outputs.

### Process

**Step 1: Define Content Type**

Select seed range based on content:
- **People/Characters**: 1000-1999
- **Action/Movement**: 2000-2999
- **Landscape/Environment**: 3000-3999
- **Product/Object**: 4000-4999
- **YouTube-Optimized**: 2000-3000 (hybrid action/people)

**Step 2: Generate Test Batch**

Generate 10-15 variations with sequential seeds:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Example: Product video (seed range 4000-4999)
for seed in {4000..4010}; do
  echo "Testing seed $seed..."

  # Generate with identical prompt, varying only seed
  result=$(curl --fail --show-error --silent -X POST \
    'https://platform.higgsfield.ai/v1/image2video/dop' \
    --header 'hf-api-key: {api-key}' \
    --header 'hf-secret: {secret}' \
    --data "{
      \"params\": {
        \"prompt\": \"[your prompt]\",
        \"seed\": $seed,
        \"model\": \"dop-turbo\"
      }
    }") || { echo "ERROR: API call failed for seed $seed" >&2; continue; }

  # Validate response before using
  job_id=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.jobs[0].id // empty' || true)
  if [[ -z "$job_id" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Failed to extract job_id for seed $seed (invalid API response)" >&2
    continue
  fi

  echo "Job $job_id queued for seed $seed"
  echo "$seed,$job_id" >> seed_bracket_results.csv
done
```

**Step 3: Score Outputs**

Evaluate each output on 5 criteria (1-10 scale):

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Composition | 25% | Framing, balance, visual hierarchy |
| Quality | 25% | Resolution, artifacts, smoothness |
| Style Adherence | 20% | Matches intended aesthetic |
| Motion Realism | 20% | Natural movement, physics |
| Subject Accuracy | 10% | Prompt adherence, details |

**Scoring Formula**:

```text
Total Score = (Composition × 0.25) + (Quality × 0.25) + (Style × 0.20) + (Motion × 0.20) + (Accuracy × 0.10)
```

**Step 4: Identify Winners**

- **Score 8.0+**: Production-ready, use immediately
- **Score 6.5-7.9**: Acceptable, minor tweaks needed
- **Score <6.5**: Discard, try different seed range

**Step 5: Iterate**

If no winners in initial range:
1. Shift to adjacent range (+/- 100)
2. Test 10 more seeds
3. If still no winners, revise prompt (likely prompt issue, not seed)

### Automation

Use `seed-bracket-helper.sh` for the full automation workflow:

```bash
# Generate 11 product video variants with seed bracketing
seed-bracket-helper.sh generate --type product --prompt "Product rotating on white background"

# Check job status
seed-bracket-helper.sh status

# Score completed outputs (composition, quality, style, motion, accuracy — each 1-10)
seed-bracket-helper.sh score 4005 8 9 7 8 9

# View report with winners and recommendations
seed-bracket-helper.sh report

# List content-type presets and scoring weights
seed-bracket-helper.sh presets
```

The helper manages bracket runs, tracks job status via the Higgsfield API, calculates weighted scores, and identifies production-ready winners (80+/100) vs acceptable outputs (65-80) vs rejects.

## 8K Camera Model Prompting

Append professional camera models to prompts for cinematic quality and specific aesthetic characteristics.

### Camera Model Library

| Camera | Aesthetic | Use Case | Color Science |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **RED Komodo 6K** | Digital cinema, sharp | Action, sports, high-motion | Vibrant, punchy reds |
| **ARRI Alexa LF** | Film-like, organic | Drama, narrative, skin tones | Warm, natural, forgiving |
| **Sony Venice 8K** | Clean, clinical | Commercial, product, precision | Neutral, accurate |
| **Blackmagic URSA 12K** | Raw, flexible | Indie, experimental | Flat, gradable |
| **Canon C500 Mark II** | Smooth, polished | Corporate, documentary | Warm, Canon color |
| **Panasonic Varicam LT** | Broadcast, reliable | News, live, fast turnaround | Neutral, broadcast-safe |

### Lens Characteristics

| Lens Type | Effect | Prompt Addition |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **35mm Anamorphic** | Cinematic, oval bokeh, lens flares | "35mm anamorphic lens, 2.39:1 aspect ratio, horizontal lens flares" |
| **50mm Prime** | Natural perspective, sharp | "50mm prime lens, shallow depth of field, sharp focus" |
| **24mm Wide** | Expansive, environmental | "24mm wide-angle lens, environmental context, slight distortion" |
| **85mm Portrait** | Flattering, compressed | "85mm portrait lens, compressed perspective, creamy bokeh" |
| **14mm Ultra-Wide** | Dramatic, immersive | "14mm ultra-wide lens, dramatic perspective, deep focus" |

### Example Prompts

**Cinematic Drama**:

```text
Shot on ARRI Alexa LF with 35mm anamorphic lens, 8K resolution, 24 fps, 2.39:1 aspect ratio.
Warm color grading, film grain texture, natural lighting with practical sources.
[rest of prompt]
```

**High-Action Sports**:

```text

Neutral color grading, clinical precision, controlled studio lighting.
[rest of prompt]
```

## 2-Track Production Workflow

Separate workflows for objects/environments vs characters optimize quality and efficiency.

### Track 1: Objects & Environments

**Pipeline**: Midjourney → Veo 3.1

**Step 1: Generate Base Image (Midjourney)**

```text
/imagine [object/environment description] --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6
```

Midjourney excels at:
- Product renders
- Architectural spaces
- Landscapes
- Abstract concepts
- Inanimate objects

**Step 2: Animate with Veo 3.1**

Upload Midjourney output as ingredient, apply VEO prompting framework for animation.

### Track 2: Characters & People

**Pipeline**: Freepik → Seedream 4 → Veo 3.1

**Step 1: Generate Character (Freepik)**

Freepik AI excels at character-driven scenes with consistent facial features.

**Step 2: Refine to 4K (Seedream 4)**

```bash
# Via Higgsfield API
curl -X POST 'https://platform.higgsfield.ai/bytedance/seedream/v4/upscale' \
  --header 'Authorization: Key {api_key}:{api_secret}' \
  --data '{
    "image_url": "https://freepik-output.jpg",
    "target_resolution": "4K"
  }'
```

**Step 3: Animate with Veo 3.1**

Upload refined character as ingredient, generate video with character consistency.

### When to Use Each Track

| Content Type | Track | Reason |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Product demo | Track 1 | Objects, no facial consistency needed |
| Landscape flythrough | Track 1 | Environment, no characters |
| Talking head | Track 2 | Facial expressions, character consistency |
| Character narrative | Track 2 | Emotional range, consistent identity |
| Mixed (character + product) | Both | Generate separately, composite in post |

## Post-Production Guidelines

### Upscaling

**REAL Video Enhancer** (open-source, GPU-accelerated) and **Topaz Video AI** (commercial) are the primary upscaling tools.

**REAL Video Enhancer** (recommended for AI-generated content):

```bash
# 2x upscale (720p → 1080p or 1080p → 4K)
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh upscale input.mp4 output.mp4 --scale 2

# 4x upscale (540p → 1080p or 720p → 4K)
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh upscale input.mp4 output.mp4 --scale 4

# Custom model selection
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh upscale input.mp4 output.mp4 \
  --scale 2 \
  --model realesrgan  # or 'span', 'animejanai'
```

**Models**:
- `span`: Fast, general-purpose (default)
- `realesrgan`: Slower, photo-realistic content
- `animejanai`: Anime/animation content

**Topaz Video AI** (commercial alternative):

**Rules**:
- Maximum 1.25-1.75x upscale (beyond this introduces artifacts)
- 1080p → 1440p: 1.33x (safe)
- 1080p → 4K: 2x (risky, only for high-quality source)
- 4K → 8K: NOT RECOMMENDED (diminishing returns, high artifact risk)

**Settings**:

```yaml
model: Artemis High Quality
noise_reduction: Low (preserve texture)
sharpening: Minimal (avoid over-sharpening)
grain_preservation: On
```

### Film Grain

Add subtle film grain for organic, less-AI-detected aesthetic.

**Recommended Settings** (DaVinci Resolve):

```yaml
grain_size: 0.5-0.8
grain_intensity: 5-10%
color_variation: 2-5%
```

**When to Apply**:
- Cinematic content: Always
- UGC content: Optional (can reduce authenticity)
- Commercial: Selective (brand-dependent)

### Frame Rate Conversion

**60 fps**: ONLY for high-action content (sports, fast motion) or social media platforms

**24 fps**: Cinematic standard, use for narrative/commercial
**30 fps**: Broadcast/web standard, use for UGC/documentary

**REAL Video Enhancer** (AI-based interpolation):

```bash
# 24 fps to 60 fps (cinematic to social media)
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh interpolate input.mp4 output.mp4 --fps 60

# 24 fps to 48 fps (balanced smoothness)
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh interpolate input.mp4 output.mp4 --fps 48

# Custom model selection
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh interpolate input.mp4 output.mp4 \
  --fps 60 \
  --model gmfss  # or 'rife', 'ifrnet'
```

**Models**:
- `rife`: Fast, high quality (default)
- `gmfss`: Slower, very high quality, complex motion
- `ifrnet`: Very fast, medium quality, low-end hardware

**Alternative Tools**:
- DaVinci Resolve: Optical Flow (best quality)
- Adobe Premiere: Frame Blending (fast, lower quality)
- Topaz Video AI: Chronos (AI-based, good for complex motion)

**CRITICAL**: Never upconvert 24 fps to 60 fps for non-action content (creates soap opera effect) unless targeting social media platforms where 60 fps is preferred

### Denoising and Artifact Removal

**REAL Video Enhancer** provides AI-powered denoising and H.264 decompression:

```bash
# Remove noise from compressed/low-quality video
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh denoise input.mp4 output.mp4

# Custom model selection
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh denoise input.mp4 output.mp4 \
  --model drunet  # or 'dncnn'
```

**Models**:
- `drunet`: Medium speed, high quality (default)
- `dncnn`: Fast, medium quality

**Full Enhancement Pipeline** (upscale + interpolate + denoise):

```bash
# All-in-one enhancement for social media delivery
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh enhance input.mp4 output.mp4 \
  --scale 2 \
  --fps 60 \
  --denoise

# Maximum quality (slower)
real-video-enhancer-helper.sh enhance input.mp4 output.mp4 \
  --scale 2 \
  --fps 60 \
  --denoise \
  --upscale-model realesrgan \
  --interpolate-model gmfss \
  --denoise-model drunet
```

**When to Use**:
- AI-generated video with compression artifacts
- Low-quality source material
- Social media delivery (upscale + interpolate + denoise)
- Batch processing video libraries

See `tools/video/real-video-enhancer.md` for full documentation.

## Longform Talking-Head Pipeline (30s+)

For talking-head videos (AI influencers, paid ads, organic content), the pipeline is **audio-driven** rather than prompt-driven. The voice audio controls lip movement and timing, so audio quality is the single biggest determinant of perceived realism.

### Pipeline Overview

```text
Starting Image → Script → Voice Audio → Talking-Head Video → Post-Processing
     (1)           (2)        (3)              (4)                (5)
```

Each step gates the next. A weak starting image or robotic audio ruins everything downstream.

### Step 1: Generate Starting Image

Use Nanobanana Pro with JSON prompts (see `content/production/image.md`) for precise color grading control. The JSON `color` and `lighting` fields prevent the flat greyscale look common in default AI generations.

**Critical**: The starting image must be high-resolution and photorealistic. Video models amplify any artifacts in the source image.

```text
Tool routing:
├─ Character/person → Nanobanana Pro (JSON color grading) or Freepik
├─ Need 4K refinement → Seedream 4 post-processing
└─ Face consistency across series → Ideogram face swap
```

See `content/production/image.md` "Nanobanana Pro JSON Prompt Schema" for the full JSON structure with color palette hex codes.

### Step 2: Generate Script

Write scripts that sound like natural speech, not written text. Key rules:

- **Contractions**: "it's", "don't", "we're" — never "it is", "do not"
- **Short sentences**: 8-12 words per sentence for natural pacing
- **Conversational fillers**: Occasional "so", "actually", "honestly" add authenticity
- **Read aloud test**: If it sounds awkward spoken, rewrite it

Use emotional block cues from `content/production/audio.md` to mark delivery changes:

```text
[excited]This completely changed how I work.[/excited]
[confident]The build quality is incredible, and it just works.[/confident]
```

### Step 3: Generate Voice Audio

**This is the most important step.** A perfect video with robotic audio gets scrolled past immediately.

#### Tool Selection

| Tool | Quality | Cost | Voice Clone | Best For |
|------|---------|------|-------------|----------|
| **ElevenLabs** | Highest | $5-99/mo | Yes (instant, 10-30s clip) | Maximum realism, custom voices |
| **MiniMax TTS** | High | $5/mo (120 min) | Yes (10s clip) | Easiest setup, best value |
| **Qwen3-TTS** | High | Free (local, CUDA) | Yes (3s clip) | Self-hosted, open source |

#### ElevenLabs Best Practices

- **NEVER use pre-made voices** for realism — they are widely recognised and signal "AI" immediately
- Use **Voice Design** to create a unique voice from a text description, or **Instant Voice Clone** with a 10-30 second clean audio clip
- For voice cloning: record in a quiet room, single speaker, clear pronunciation, no background music
- Always run through the CapCut cleanup pipeline first if cloning from existing content (see `content/production/audio.md`)

#### MiniMax TTS

MiniMax (Hailuo) offers the best quality-to-effort ratio for talking-head content:

- Default voice output is already natural-sounding with minimal configuration
- Voice clone works well with just a 10-second reference clip
- $5/month for 120 minutes of generation — best value in the category
- API available via Higgsfield platform (web UI) or direct MiniMax API

#### Qwen3-TTS (Open Source)

Solid self-hosted alternative requiring CUDA GPU. See `tools/voice/qwen3-tts.md` for full setup.

- 3-second reference clip for voice cloning
- Instruction-controlled emotion and prosody
- 97ms streaming latency for real-time applications

### Step 4: Generate Talking-Head Video

Feed the starting image + voice audio to a talking-head model. These models animate the face to match the audio, handling lip sync, facial expressions, and head movement.

#### Model Selection

| Model | Quality | Cost | Open Source | Best For |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|----------|
| **HeyGen Avatar 4** | High | Subscription | No | Best all-around, easiest workflow |
| **VEED Fabric 1.0** | Highest | Higher than HeyGen | No | Maximum quality, premium content |
| **InfiniteTalk** | Good | Free (self-hosted) | Yes | Budget/self-hosted, decent quality |

#### HeyGen Avatar 4

Best all-around model for talking-head generation. Handles lip sync, expressions, and natural head movement well. See `tools/video/heygen-skill.md` for full API integration.

**Workflow**:

1. Upload starting image as photo avatar (see `heygen-skill/rules/photo-avatars.md`)
2. Upload voice audio as audio asset (see `heygen-skill/rules/assets.md`)
3. Generate video with audio input (see `heygen-skill/rules/video-generation.md`)

#### VEED Fabric 1.0

Higher quality than HeyGen but at a premium price point. Best for content where maximum realism justifies the cost (paid ads, brand content).

- Accessible via MuAPI lipsync endpoint: `POST /api/v1/veed-lipsync` (see `tools/video/muapi.md`)
- Also available via VEED's direct platform

#### InfiniteTalk (Open Source)

Voice-to-video model for self-hosted talking-head generation. Decent quality for an open-source solution.

- GitHub: search for "InfiniteTalk voice-to-video"
- Requires GPU for inference
- Good for high-volume generation where API costs would be prohibitive
- Quality gap vs HeyGen/VEED is narrowing with each release

### Step 5: Post-Processing

After generating the talking-head video:

1. **Upscale** if needed: `real-video-enhancer-helper.sh upscale input.mp4 output.mp4 --scale 2`
2. **Denoise**: `real-video-enhancer-helper.sh denoise input.mp4 output.mp4` (removes compression artifacts)
3. **Film grain**: Add subtle grain for organic aesthetic (see Post-Production Guidelines below)
4. **Audio mix**: Layer ambient sound and music behind the voice (see `content/production/audio.md` 4-Layer Audio Design)

### Longform Assembly (30s+ Videos)

For videos longer than a single generation window:

1. **Split script into segments** matching the model's maximum duration (e.g., 10s for HeyGen)
2. **Generate each segment** with the same starting image and voice settings for consistency
3. **Stitch segments** in a video editor or with ffmpeg:

```bash
# Concatenate segments
printf "file '%s'\n" segment_*.mp4 > concat.txt
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i concat.txt -c copy longform_output.mp4
```

4. **Add B-roll cuts** between segments to hide any transition artifacts
5. **Final audio pass**: Replace stitched audio with the original full-length voice track for seamless audio continuity

### Use Case Routing

| Use Case | Starting Image | Voice | Video Model | Post-Processing |
|----------|---------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Paid ads** | Nanobanana Pro (brand colors) | ElevenLabs (custom clone) | VEED Fabric | Full pipeline |
| **Organic social** | Nanobanana Pro or Freepik | MiniMax (default voice) | HeyGen Avatar 4 | Light denoise |
| **AI influencer** | Nanobanana Pro (consistent character) | ElevenLabs (cloned persona) | HeyGen Avatar 4 | Film grain + upscale |
| **Budget/volume** | Freepik | Qwen3-TTS (local) | InfiniteTalk | Minimal |
