# Email-to-Action Agent

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Bridge between inbound email and the rest of the system — todos, reports, legal case files, opportunities, support escalations
- **Helper**: `scripts/email-triage-helper.sh [command] [options]`
- **Config**: `configs/email-actions-config.json` (from `.json.txt` template)
- **IMAP folders**: `Projects/`, `Legal/`, `Reports/`, `Opportunities/`, `Support/`
- **Database**: `~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/email-agent/actions.db` (SQLite)

**Decision rule**: Every inbound email falls into one of five action categories. Classify first, then act.

| Category | Action | IMAP folder |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Task trigger | Create TODO entry | `Projects/` |
| Report | Triage and file | `Reports/` |
| Opportunity | Flag for review | `Opportunities/` |
| Legal/compliance | Assemble case file | `Legal/` |
| Support | Escalate or resolve | `Support/` |

**Quick commands:**

```bash
# Triage a single email
email-triage-helper.sh triage --message-id <id>

# Batch triage inbox
email-triage-helper.sh batch --folder INBOX --since 24h

# Assemble legal case file
email-triage-helper.sh legal-case --thread-id <id> --output ~/cases/

# Extract newsletter training material
email-triage-helper.sh extract-training --sender newsletter@domain.com
```

## Classification Decision Tree

Before acting on any email, classify it. Classification drives the action — wrong classification wastes time or loses signal.

```text
Inbound email
    │
    ├── Is it from a known automated sender (report, alert, notification)?
    │       YES → Report triage (see "Report Triage" section)
    │       NO  ↓
    │
    ├── Does it contain a legal notice, contract, dispute, or compliance requirement?
    │       YES → Legal case file (see "Legal Case Files" section)
    │       NO  ↓
    │
    ├── Does it describe a business opportunity, partnership, or lead?
    │       YES → Opportunity flag (see "Opportunities" section)
    │       NO  ↓
    │
    ├── Is it a support request, complaint, or escalation from a customer/user?
    │       YES → Support escalation (see "Support Communication" section)
    │       NO  ↓
    │
    ├── Does it require a concrete action (deadline, deliverable, decision)?
    │       YES → Create TODO (see "Email-to-Todo Patterns" section)
    │       NO  ↓
    │
    └── Archive or unsubscribe (no action required)
```

## Email-to-Todo Patterns

### When to Create a Task

Create a TODO entry when the email contains:

- An explicit deadline ("please respond by...", "renewal on...", "expires...")
- A deliverable you own ("can you send...", "please review...", "we need...")
- A decision that blocks someone else
- A follow-up you promised in a previous thread

Do **not** create a task for:
- FYI emails with no action required
- Automated reports (file under Reports instead)
- Newsletters (extract training material instead)
- Emails you've already acted on in the same session

### Task Creation Pattern

```bash
# Claim a task ID atomically
task_id=$(claim-task-id.sh --repo-path ~/Git/aidevops --title "Email: <subject>")

# Add to TODO.md with email reference
# Format: - [ ] tNNN Description ~Xh ref=email:<message-id>
```

### Task Brief from Email

Every task created from an email needs a brief at `todo/tasks/{task_id}-brief.md`. Populate it from the email:

| Brief field | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| Origin | Email subject + sender + date |
| What | The action requested |
| Why | Context from the email body |
| How | Your planned approach |
| Acceptance criteria | The email's stated requirements or deadline |

### IMAP Archiving

After creating the task, move the email to `Projects/` in IMAP:

```bash
email-triage-helper.sh move --message-id <id> --folder Projects/ \
  --tag "task:tNNN"
```

## Report Triage

Automated reports arrive from SEO tools, domain registrars, hosting providers, analytics platforms, and monitoring services. Most require no action — but some contain time-sensitive signals.

### Source Authentication

Before acting on any report email, verify the sender is legitimate:

```bash
# Check SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment
email-triage-helper.sh verify-sender --message-id <id>

# Check against known sender list
email-triage-helper.sh check-sender --from "reports@domain.com"
```

**Known-sender validation**: Maintain a list of expected report senders in `configs/email-actions-config.json` under `trusted_report_senders`. Any report from an unknown sender should be treated as suspicious until DNS checks pass.

**DNS checks to run:**

```bash
# Verify SPF record
dig TXT <sender-domain> | grep "v=spf1"

# Verify DMARC policy
dig TXT _dmarc.<sender-domain>

# Check if domain is recently registered (phishing signal)
whois <sender-domain> | grep "Creation Date"
```

### Report Categories and Actions

| Report type | Signal to act on | Action |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| SEO ranking report | Significant drop (>10 positions) or new opportunity | Create task, tag `#seo` |
| Domain expiry notice | Expiry within 60 days | Create task with deadline, tag `#renewal` |
| SSL certificate expiry | Expiry within 30 days | Create task with deadline, tag `#infra` |
| Hosting/server alert | Downtime, capacity warning | Create task immediately, tag `#infra` |
| Analytics anomaly | Traffic spike or drop >20% | Flag for review, tag `#analytics` |
| Optimization suggestion | Actionable recommendation | Add to backlog, tag `#optimization` |
| Renewal invoice | Payment due | Create task with deadline, tag `#billing` |
| Compliance notification | Regulatory requirement | Legal case file (see below) |

### Report Filing

Reports that require no immediate action should still be filed for reference:

```bash
# File report with metadata
email-triage-helper.sh file-report \
  --message-id <id> \
  --category seo \
  --folder Reports/SEO/ \
  --summary "Ranking report: 3 drops, 1 new opportunity"
```

### Renewal and Expiry Tracking

Domain, SSL, and subscription renewals are high-value signals — missing them causes outages or data loss.

```bash
# Extract expiry dates from email body
email-triage-helper.sh extract-dates --message-id <id>

# Add to renewal tracker
email-triage-helper.sh track-renewal \
  --service "domain.com" \
  --expiry "2026-12-01" \
  --source-email <message-id>
```

Renewal tasks should be created 60 days before expiry (domains), 30 days (SSL), and 14 days (subscriptions). Set `blocked-by:` to the renewal task on any task that depends on the service.

## Legal Case Files

Legal emails include: contracts, disputes, GDPR/DMCA/legal notices, court documents, compliance requirements, and any email from a lawyer or legal department.

### Chain of Custody

Legal case files must preserve chain of custody metadata:

- Original email headers (From, To, Date, Message-ID, Received)
- Timestamp of receipt (server-side, not client-side)
- Any attachments in original format
- Thread context (all prior messages in the thread)

**Never modify the original email.** Export a read-only copy; keep the original in IMAP under `Legal/`.

### Case File Assembly

```bash
# Assemble a case file from a thread
email-triage-helper.sh legal-case \
  --thread-id <id> \
  --output ~/cases/case-$(date +%Y%m%d)-<description>/ \
  --format pdf \
  --include-headers \
  --include-attachments

# Output structure:
# case-20260316-vendor-dispute/
# ├── thread-export.pdf       (full thread, headers visible)
# ├── thread-export.txt       (plain text, machine-readable)
# ├── metadata.json           (message IDs, timestamps, participants)
# ├── attachments/            (original files, unchanged)
# └── chain-of-custody.txt    (hash of each file + timestamp)
```

### Chain of Custody File Format

```text
Case: <description>
Assembled: <ISO timestamp>
Assembler: <agent session ID>

Files:
  thread-export.pdf   SHA256: <hash>
  thread-export.txt   SHA256: <hash>
  metadata.json       SHA256: <hash>
  attachments/<file>  SHA256: <hash>

Original IMAP folder: Legal/<subfolder>
Original Message-IDs: <list>
```

### IMAP Folder Structure for Legal

```text
Legal/
├── Active/          # Ongoing matters
├── Resolved/        # Closed matters
├── Contracts/       # Signed agreements
├── Notices/         # GDPR, DMCA, compliance
└── Disputes/        # Vendor, customer, IP disputes
```

### Legal Task Creation

Every legal email requires a task, even if the action is "review and decide":

```bash
# Create legal task with high priority
claim-task-id.sh --repo-path ~/Git/aidevops \
  --title "Legal: <subject>" \
  --priority high \
  --tag legal
```

Legal tasks should never be auto-dispatched to workers without human review. Add `assignee:human` to the TODO entry.

## Opportunities

Business opportunities include: partnership proposals, inbound sales leads, collaboration requests, press/media inquiries, and investor outreach.

### Opportunity Qualification

Not every opportunity email deserves a response. Qualify before acting:

| Signal | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Personalised (references your work specifically) | High |
| From a known company or individual | High |
| Clear value proposition | Medium |
| Specific ask (not a mass blast) | Medium |
| Generic template, no personalisation | Low |
| No company name or verifiable identity | Low |

```bash
# Flag opportunity for review
email-triage-helper.sh flag-opportunity \
  --message-id <id> \
  --score <1-5> \
  --notes "Partnership proposal from Acme — references our SEO work"
```

### Opportunity IMAP Folders

```text
Opportunities/
├── Hot/             # Score 4-5, respond within 24h
├── Warm/            # Score 2-3, respond within 1 week
├── Cold/            # Score 1, archive after 30 days
└── Responded/       # Awaiting reply
```

### CRM Integration

High-score opportunities should be added to the CRM pipeline:

```bash
# Add to CRM (FluentCRM or equivalent)
email-triage-helper.sh crm-add \
  --message-id <id> \
  --pipeline "Inbound Opportunities" \
  --stage "New Lead" \
  --contact-email <sender>
```

## Support Communication

Support emails come from customers, users, or partners who need help. The goal is to understand the receiver's capabilities and route to the right resolution path.

### Understanding Receiver Capabilities

Before responding to a support email, assess what the receiver can actually do:

| Receiver type | Capabilities | Escalation path |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| End user (non-technical) | UI actions only | Step-by-step guide, screenshots |
| Technical user | CLI, config files | Direct instructions |
| Business contact | Decisions, approvals | Executive summary, options |
| Legal/compliance | Formal process | Structured response, documentation |

### Escalation Patterns

```text
Support email received
    │
    ├── Can it be resolved with information? → Draft response, no task needed
    │
    ├── Does it require a code fix or config change? → Create task, tag #support
    │
    ├── Is it a billing or account issue? → Route to accounts agent
    │
    ├── Is it a legal or compliance issue? → Route to legal case file workflow
    │
    └── Is it a complaint that could escalate? → Flag for human review
```

### Response Drafting

```bash
# Draft a support response
email-triage-helper.sh draft-response \
  --message-id <id> \
  --template support-reply \
  --tone professional \
  --output draft.md
```

Review all drafted responses before sending. The agent drafts; a human (or the email-agent with explicit approval) sends.

### Support IMAP Folders

```text
Support/
├── Open/            # Awaiting resolution
├── Pending/         # Waiting for customer reply
├── Resolved/        # Closed tickets
└── Escalated/       # Requires human or specialist review
```

## Newsletter Training Material Extraction

Newsletters from domain experts, industry publications, and thought leaders contain high-value training material: writing style, domain knowledge, terminology, and content patterns.

### Which Newsletters to Extract From

Extract training material from newsletters that demonstrate:

- **Domain expertise**: Deep technical or industry knowledge relevant to your work
- **Writing style**: Tone, structure, or format you want to emulate
- **Content patterns**: How they structure arguments, explain concepts, or present data

Do **not** extract from:
- Mass-market newsletters with generic content
- Newsletters you're subscribed to for news only (not style/knowledge)
- Newsletters with paywalled or proprietary content (check terms)

### Extraction Workflow

```bash
# Extract domain knowledge from a newsletter
email-triage-helper.sh extract-training \
  --message-id <id> \
  --type domain-knowledge \
  --output ~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/training/newsletters/

# Extract writing style examples
email-triage-helper.sh extract-training \
  --message-id <id> \
  --type writing-style \
  --output ~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/training/style/

# Batch extract from a sender
email-triage-helper.sh extract-training \
  --sender "newsletter@domain.com" \
  --since 90d \
  --type domain-knowledge
```

### Training Material Format

Extracted material is stored as structured markdown:

```markdown
---
source: newsletter@domain.com
date: 2026-03-16
type: domain-knowledge
topics: [seo, content-strategy]
---

# Key concepts extracted

- <concept 1>
- <concept 2>

# Notable phrasing

> <quote worth preserving>

# Writing patterns

- <structural pattern observed>
```

### Newsletter IMAP Folders

```text
Newsletters/
├── Training/        # High-value, extract from these
├── Reference/       # Keep for reference, don't extract
└── Unsubscribe/     # Queue for unsubscription
```

## Configuration

### Config Template

`configs/email-actions-config.json.txt` — copy to `configs/email-actions-config.json` and customise.

Key settings:

```json
{
  "trusted_report_senders": [
    "reports@semrush.com",
    "noreply@google.com",
    "alerts@cloudflare.com"
  ],
  "renewal_warning_days": {
    "domain": 60,
    "ssl": 30,
    "subscription": 14
  },
  "opportunity_auto_crm_threshold": 4,
  "legal_folder": "Legal/Active/",
  "training_output_dir": "~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/training/newsletters/",
  "support_escalation_keywords": [
    "legal action", "refund", "complaint", "GDPR", "data breach"
  ]
}
```

## Security

- **Sender verification before action**: Always run DNS checks before acting on report emails
- **Legal files are read-only**: Never modify exported case files after assembly
- **Chain of custody hashes**: Verify file hashes before submitting legal case files
- **No credential logging**: Support responses must never include credentials or internal system details
- **Opportunity scoring is local**: Scores and notes stay in the local database, not in email replies
- **Training material**: Respect newsletter terms of service; do not redistribute extracted content
