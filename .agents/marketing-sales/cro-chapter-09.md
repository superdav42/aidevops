# Chapter 9: Pricing Page Psychology

Pricing pages are the most scrutinized pages on any site. Presentation psychology often impacts conversion more than any other element.

## Anchoring

First price seen sets expectations for all subsequent prices.

**Descending order wins** — anchor to highest price, making middle tiers feel reasonable:

```text
Enterprise: $299/mo → Professional: $99/mo → Basic: $29/mo
```

Ascending anchors to $29; $99 feels 3.4x more. Descending anchors to $299; $99 feels like 67% discount. Optimizely test: descending order increased Professional signups 37%.

**Strikethrough anchors**: only genuine previous prices or MSRP. Competitive anchoring ("Competitors charge $299, we charge $149") must be truthful.

**Annual vs. monthly display**:

- Maximize monthly signups → show monthly price prominently
- Maximize annual conversions → show annual as monthly equivalent ("$79/mo billed annually")
- Maximize revenue → test both; annual often wins on transaction value despite fewer conversions

## Decoy Pricing (Asymmetric Dominance)

A third option designed to make the target option obviously better by comparison.

**Classic example** (Dan Ariely / The Economist):

- Online Only: $59 | Print Only: $125 (decoy) | Online + Print: $125
- With decoy: 84% chose Online+Print. Without: 32%. Revenue per customer: $80 → $114 (+43%).

**Decoy rules**: must be (1) inferior to target, (2) similar in price, (3) clearly worse value.

**SaaS example** — goal: sell Pro ($99/mo):

| Plan | Price | Limits |
|------|-------|--------|
| Starter | $29/mo | 10 users, 50GB, email support |
| **Pro** <- TARGET | **$99/mo** | 50 users, 500GB, phone support, analytics |
| Team <- DECOY | $89/mo | 30 users, 100GB, email support |

Team is $10 cheaper than Pro but offers far less — Pro becomes the obvious value choice.

## Charm Pricing (Left-Digit Effect)

Prices ending in 9/99/95. Left-to-right processing weights the leftmost digit: $3.99 reads as "three-something."

**MIT/UChicago (2003)**: Identical clothing at $34 (16 sales), $39 (21 sales, +31%), $44 (17 sales). Charm price outperformed both lower and higher.

| Ending | Signal | Best for |
|--------|--------|----------|
| .99 | Sale/value | Retail |
| .95 | Slightly upscale | SaaS ($29.95/mo) |
| .97 | Clearance | No strong advantage |
| .00 | Premium/luxury | Professional services, high-ticket |

**Use charm pricing for**: consumer products, impulse purchases, competitive markets, sale pricing.
**Avoid for**: luxury, professional B2B, premium positioning.

Real examples: Apple ($999/$1,999) — premium + charm at threshold. McKinsey ($100,000/$500,000) — round numbers only.

## Price Framing

**Time-based**: Break large sums into daily costs.

- $365/yr = "Just $1/day"
- $10,000/yr = "Just $27/day — less than 30 min of an employee's time"

**Unit economics**: $499/mo for 25 users = "Less than $20/user/month"

**Comparative framing** — against alternatives:

- Professional Photography: $2,000 vs DIY ($800 + time + quality) vs Competitors ($3,000-$5,000)
- Website Security: $99/mo vs Data breach ($4.24M avg, IBM) vs Legal fees ($100K+)

**Loss vs. gain framing**:

| Loss (typically stronger) | Gain |
|--------------------------|------|
| "Don't waste $10K/year on inefficient processes" | "Save $10K/year with automation" |
| "Stop losing 20% of leads" | "Capture 20% more leads" |

Use loss framing for known pain points, security, prevention. Gain framing for new opportunities, aspirational products. Test both — audiences differ.

## Tiered Pricing

**Optimal tier count**: 3. Too few (1-2) = no segmentation. Too many (5+) = analysis paralysis.

**Tier naming**:

| Type | Examples | Perceived value |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Generic | Basic/Standard/Premium | Low-Medium |
| Aspirational | Silver/Gold/Platinum, Essential/Plus/Ultimate | Higher |
| Niche-specific | Individual/Team/Organization | Highest relevance |

**Highlight the middle tier** (larger card, "Most Popular" badge, different color). Decoy effect makes it the obvious choice; pushes users off lowest tier; leaves Enterprise as upsell path. Highlight highest tier instead when targeting enterprise or anchoring high.

**Feature differentiation mistakes**: too similar (no price-jump justification), too different (gap too large), feature stuffing (30+ features overwhelms).

**Effective value ladder**:

- Starter ($29/mo): 10 users, 50GB, email support, core features
- **Pro ($99/mo) <- MOST POPULAR**: 50 users, 500GB, phone support, analytics, API
- Enterprise ($299/mo): Unlimited, dedicated AM, SSO, SLA, custom integrations

**Pricing model comparison**:

| Model | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| Feature-based | Clear differentiation, predictable revenue | Can feel artificially limited |
| Usage-based | Scales with growth, feels fair | Unpredictable revenue, overage anxiety |
| Hybrid | Best of both | More complex to communicate |

**Annual discount sweet spot**: 15-25%. Below 10% = not compelling. Above 30% = signals desperation. Most successful SaaS: 15-20% (Basecamp ~16%, ConvertKit 20%, HubSpot ~17%).

**Annual/monthly toggle**: use when annual billing is a key revenue goal. Show savings badge prominently ("Save 20%"). Default to monthly; let users switch to annual.

## Enterprise Pricing ("Contact Sales")

**Use when**: truly custom pricing, ACV $50K+, complex sales, qualification needed, competitive sensitivity.

**Anti-patterns**: haven't figured out pricing, want to seem premium, hiding uncompetitive prices.

**Impact by context**:

| Scenario | Visible price | Contact Sales |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| SaaS ($499/mo) | 47 trial clicks, avg $6K/yr -> $282K potential | 12 clicks, avg $8.5K/yr -> $102K potential |
| Enterprise software ($25K/yr+) | 8 contacts, avg $32K | 23 contacts, avg $67K |

Visible pricing won for mid-market SaaS; Contact Sales won for enterprise (qualified out small prospects, enabled larger deals).

**Hybrid "Starting at X"**: sets anchor, signals flexibility, reduces sticker shock, qualifies out low-budget prospects.

## Free Trial vs. Freemium

**Free trial** — full/partial access for limited time (7/14/30 days):

- Strengths: urgency, full product experience, predictable conversion window
- Weaknesses: acquisition friction, may not be enough time for complex products
- Use when: quick time-to-value, short sales cycle

**Credit card at signup**:

| Metric | CC required | No CC |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Trial signups | 60-80% fewer | Higher volume |
| Conversion to paid | 40-60% | 10-15% |
| Net revenue | Varies | Often higher due to volume |

**Freemium** — free tier with limited features/usage:

- Strengths: low friction, viral growth, habit formation
- Weaknesses: no urgency, support costs, 2-5% avg conversion rate
- Use when: network effects matter, viral growth critical, low marginal cost per user

**Hybrid (trial of premium + freemium fallback)**: 14-day premium trial -> upgrade or downgrade to free. Best of both: urgency + safety net. Used by Canva (30-day Pro trial -> generous Free tier).

## Money-Back Guarantees

**Types**:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Time-based | "30-Day Money-Back — no questions asked" |
| Conditional | "Double Your Traffic or Your Money Back in 90 days" |
| Satisfaction | "Love it or return it — for any reason, at any time" |
| Lifetime | "If it ever fails, we'll replace it free" |

**Placement** (highest to lowest impact): pricing page -> checkout -> product pages -> exit-intent popups.

**Framing strength**:

- Weak: "We offer refunds"
- Medium: "30-day money-back guarantee"
- Strong: "Love It or Your Money Back — Guaranteed"
- Strongest: add specificity — "If not satisfied within 30 days, email us for a full refund within 24 hours — no questions asked"

Adding "no questions asked" to a 30-day guarantee: +18% conversions, +2% refund rate (net positive).

**Guarantee length**:

| Length | Effect | Best for |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 7-14 days | Creates urgency | Digital products |
| 30 days | Balanced, most common | Most products |
| 60-90 days | Powerful risk reversal | Complex products |
| 365 days / Lifetime | Maximum confidence | Durable goods (Zappos: core brand identity) |

Combine multiple trust signals near CTA: secure checkout badge + guarantee seal + shipping policy + review score.
