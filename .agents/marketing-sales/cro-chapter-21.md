# Chapter 21: CRO Testing Masterclass

## 21.1 Hypothesis Development

### Hypothesis Framework

Structure: **IF** [change], **THEN** [expected result], **BECAUSE** [reasoning]

Example: "IF we simplify checkout from 12 to 6 fields, THEN checkout completion increases 15%, BECAUSE reducing friction removes purchase barriers"

**Data Sources:**
- Analytics drop-off points
- Heatmap clicks/scrolls
- Session recordings
- User surveys and support tickets
- Competitor benchmarking

**Prioritization Matrix:**

| Factor | Weight | Score | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| Potential Impact | 30% | 8 | 2.4 |
| Confidence | 20% | 7 | 1.4 |
| Ease of Implementation | 25% | 9 | 2.25 |
| Resource Requirements | 25% | 6 | 1.5 |
| **Total** | | | **7.55** |

## 21.2 Advanced Test Design

### Factorial Experiments

Test multiple variables simultaneously to detect interaction effects.

Example (2×2×2 = 8 variations): Headline A/B × Image X/Y × CTA Red/Blue

| | Benefits | Challenges |
|-|----------|------------|
| Factorial | Interaction effects, sample-efficient when interactions matter | Complex analysis, more traffic, implementation complexity |

### Bandit Algorithms

Dynamic traffic allocation to winning variations during the test.

**Epsilon-Greedy:** 90% traffic to current best, 10% exploration, adapts in real-time

**Use cases:** Continuous optimization, long-running campaigns, seasonal adjustments

## 21.3 Statistical Rigor

### Error Types

| Error | Definition | Control |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Type I (False Positive) | Declaring winner when no real difference | Significance level α = 0.05 |
| Type II (False Negative) | Missing a real improvement | Power 1-β = 0.8 |

### Sequential Testing

Stop tests early **only with pre-specified stopping rules** — ad-hoc stopping inflates false positive rates.

**Valid early-stopping methods:**
- O'Brien-Fleming boundaries (conservative early, lenient late)
- Pocock boundaries (equal spending at each interim look)
- Always Valid P-values (anytime-valid inference)
- Alpha-spending functions (flexible interim analysis scheduling)

**Benefits:** Faster decisions, lower opportunity cost, reduced sample size while maintaining validity

## 21.4 Test Analysis Deep Dive

### Segment-Level Analysis

**Dimensions:** Device type, traffic source, new vs returning, geography, browser

```sql
SELECT 
  device_type,
  variation,
  COUNT(*) as users,
  SUM(converted) as conversions,
  AVG(converted) as conversion_rate
FROM test_data
WHERE test_id = 'TEST_001'
GROUP BY device_type, variation
```

### Cohort Analysis

Track how test effects change over time.

**Dimensions:** Day of week, week of test, acquisition cohort

**Interpret for:** Novelty effects (initial excitement), seasonality impacts, sustained vs temporary lift
