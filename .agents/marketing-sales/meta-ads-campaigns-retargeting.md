# Retargeting Campaign

> Most efficient spend — but most limited pool and lowest incrementality. Don't over-invest.

---

## Fundamentals

Showing ads to people who already interacted with your brand (site visit, engagement, cart, existing customer).

- 2% convert on first visit; retargeted visitors 70% more likely to convert
- 3-7 touchpoints before purchase is typical

### Incrementality Warning

| Campaign Type | Typical Incrementality |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Retargeting (cart abandoners) | 20-40% |
| Retargeting (site visitors) | 40-60% |
| Prospecting (lookalike) | 60-80% |
| Prospecting (broad) | 70-90% |

Many retargeting conversions would have happened anyway. CPA looks great; true value is lower.

### Retargeting vs Prospecting Budget

Retargeting audience is finite. Prospecting creates the retargeting pool — without it, the pool shrinks.

## Audience Architecture

### Website Visitor Audiences

**By Page Type:**

### Customer Lists

## Retargeting Windows

### By Industry

**E-commerce (<$100):**

| Window | Budget % | Message Focus |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1-3 days | 40% | Cart reminder, urgency |
| 4-7 days | 30% | Social proof, FOMO |
| 8-14 days | 20% | New offer, discount |
| 15-30 days | 10% | Final attempt |

**E-commerce (>$500):**

| Window | Budget % | Message Focus |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1-7 days | 30% | More info, FAQ |
| 8-14 days | 25% | Testimonials, reviews |
| 15-30 days | 25% | Case studies, comparison |
| 31-60 days | 20% | Special offer |

**B2B SaaS:**

| Window | Budget % | Message Focus |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1-7 days | 20% | Value proposition |
| 8-14 days | 25% | Case study, results |
| 15-30 days | 25% | Demo offer |
| 31-90 days | 30% | Content nurture |

**Lead Gen:**

| Window | Budget % | Message Focus |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1-3 days | 35% | Form reminder |
| 4-7 days | 30% | Social proof |
| 8-14 days | 25% | Different angle |
| 15-30 days | 10% | Final push |

### 180-Day Waste

Avoid 180-day windows. After 60 days, move to prospecting lookalike or awareness-only. Visitors from 6 months ago are effectively cold traffic.

## Frequency Management

| Audience | Max Frequency | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Cart abandoners (3 days) | 5-7x | High intent, short window |
| Site visitors (7 days) | 3-4x | Still warm |
| Site visitors (14 days) | 2-3x | Cooling off |
| Engagers (30 days) | 2-3x | Casual interest |
| Engagers (60+ days) | 1-2x | Light touch |

| Condition | High Frequency |
|-----------|---------------|
| Works | Hot audience, short window, creative rotation, time-sensitive offer |
| Hurts | Same ad repeated, long window, no rotation, non-urgent message |

**Setting caps:** `Ad Set → Edit → Optimization & Delivery → Frequency Cap`. Or use Reach & Frequency buying type. Without caps, control via budget (lower = lower frequency), audience size (bigger = lower frequency), and creative rotation.

| Placement | Acceptable Frequency |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Feed | 2-4x/week |
| Stories | 5-7x/week (fleeting) |
| Reels | 3-5x/week |
| Audience Network | 1-2x/week |

## Sequential Retargeting

| Stage | User Behavior | Message Focus | Creative Type |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Page view only | Problem/solution intro | Educational video |
| 2 | Viewed products | Social proof, benefits | Testimonials |
| 3 | Added to cart | Overcome objections | FAQ, guarantees |
| 4 | Abandoned checkout | Urgency, discount | Offer with deadline |
| 5 | Purchased | Upsell/cross-sell | Related products |

**Example copy by stage:**

- **Stage 1:** `"Discovered [Brand]? Here's what 10,000+ customers already know..." → Learn More`
- **Stage 2:** `"Still thinking about [Product]? Here's what [Customer] said..." → See More Reviews`
- **Stage 3:** `"Complete your order — [Product] is waiting. ✓ Free shipping ✓ 30-day returns ✓ 24/7 support → Complete Purchase"`

**Progressive offer strategy:**

| Stage | Offer | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | None | Build interest first |
| 2 | Free shipping | Low commitment |
| 3 | 10% off | Nudge to convert |
| 4 | 15% + urgency | Final push |
| 5 | N/A (purchased) | Upsell at full price |

Don't train customers to expect discounts. Use sparingly.

## Budget Allocation

| Site Traffic | RT % of Budget |
|--------------|----------------|
| <10K visitors/mo | 10-15% |
| 10-50K visitors/mo | 15-20% |
| 50-100K visitors/mo | 20-25% |
| 100K+ visitors/mo | 25-30% |

**By intent:**

| Segment | Budget Priority |
|---------|-----------------|
| Cart abandoners | 30-40% of RT budget |
| Pricing/checkout visitors | 20-30% |
| Product viewers | 20-25% |
| All site visitors | 10-15% |
| Engagers only | 5-10% |

**Expected value calculation:**

```text
Audience (Cart Abandoners): Size 1,000 × CVR 10% × Max CPA $30 = $3,000/month max budget
Audience (All Visitors): Size 10,000 × CVR 2% × Max CPA $30 = $6,000/month max budget
```

**Diminishing returns signals:** frequency >5 sustained, CPA rising while reach flat, negative feedback increasing, ROAS declining. Cap RT at 25-30% of total spend and shift to prospecting.

## Dynamic Ads (DPA)

Automatically show users products they've viewed or related products based on catalog data.

**Requirements:** Product catalog in Commerce Manager, Pixel with product events (ViewContent, AddToCart, Purchase), matching product IDs between pixel and catalog.

| Audience Type | Shows |
|---------------|-------|
| Viewed but not purchased | Exact products viewed |
| Added to cart | Cart items |
| Purchased | Cross-sell/upsell |
| Broad (prospecting) | Products likely to interest |

**Best practices:**

- High-quality product images, accurate prices, clear titles, in-stock only
- Add overlay (discount, free shipping)
- Exclude already purchased
- Use product set filters (price >$20, category = bestsellers)

**Template copy:**

```text
Primary text: {{product.name}} is waiting for you! | You viewed this — still interested?
Headline: Shop Now | {{product.price}} - Limited Stock | Free Shipping on {{product.name}}
```
