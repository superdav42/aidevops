# Query Fan-Out Research

Simulate how AI systems decompose broad prompts into sub-queries and use that map to guide coverage.

## Quick Reference

- Purpose: expose hidden sub-query themes behind user intents
- Inputs: seed intent, market context, existing page set
- Outputs: fan-out map, priority tiers, coverage matrix, implementation backlog

## Workflow

### 1) Generate theme branches

- Start with one core user intent
- Produce 3-7 thematic branches (selection criteria, trust checks, risk checks, alternatives, constraints)
- Keep each branch as a distinct retrieval objective

### 2) Create actionable sub-queries

- Generate sub-queries per theme with clear purpose tags
- Tag each sub-query: high, medium, low priority
- Include common modifiers (location, budget, urgency, compliance, integration)

### 3) Map pages to branches

- Link each sub-query to best existing page
- Mark branch coverage: complete, partial, missing
- Flag where one page tries to cover too many unrelated branches

### 4) Build remediation plan

- Add concise sections for partial branches
- Create focused support pages only for genuinely missing high-priority branches
- Add internal links that mirror fan-out relationships

### 5) Validate with retrieval simulation

- Re-run fan-out prompts and compare page/sentence match quality
- Confirm top branches are answered by high-confidence sections
- Record unresolved branches for next sprint

## Guardrails

- Optimize for thematic completeness, not maximal query count
- Avoid duplicate pages targeting near-identical branches
- Keep branch language aligned with user phrasing from real queries
- Re-baseline when SERP intent or product positioning changes
