# AI Search Readiness

Run a complete, high-signal workflow to improve AI search citations and answer quality.

## Quick Reference

- **Inputs**: target intents, priority pages, fact inventory, competitor set
- **Outputs**: prioritized fixes with measurable readiness deltas
- **Scorecard**: `seo/ai-search-kpi-template.md`
- **Cadence**: monthly baseline; sprint-level re-tests after content changes

## Execution Sequence

### Phase 0: Grounding eligibility gate

- Classify queries by likelihood of triggering search grounding; prioritize intents where retrieval can be influenced by SEO changes
- Validate crawler/bot accessibility so eligible queries can fetch content
- Run site-query readiness checks: `site:yourdomain.com [product category] features`, `site:yourdomain.com pricing`, `site:yourdomain.com integrations`

### Phase 1: Query decomposition

Use `query-fanout-research.md` → thematic branches and sub-query map per intent

### Phase 2: Criteria alignment

Use `geo-strategy.md` → criteria matrix and page-level strong/partial/missing coverage map

### Phase 3: Snippet survivability

Use `sro-grounding.md` → top-of-page and sentence-level changes that improve selection likelihood

### Phase 4: Integrity hardening

Use `ai-hallucination-defense.md` → contradiction fixes, claim-evidence alignment, canonical fact hygiene

### Phase 5: Autonomous discoverability

Use `ai-agent-discovery.md` → task-completion diagnostics and discoverability gap remediation

### Phase 6: Citation and volatility monitoring

- Track citation frequency and confidence by intent cluster; monitor volatility and re-run high-impact intents on schedule
- Keep a rolling benchmark so wins are distinguished from noise
- Audit third-party citation readiness quarterly: verify G2/Capterra/TrustRadius profiles are current and fact-aligned with canonical site pages
- Use UTM-tagged profile links and partner citations so citation-driven sessions and conversion contribution are measurable

## Readiness Scorecard

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| Fan-out coverage | % of high-priority branches fully covered |
| Grounding eligibility | % of target intents likely to trigger retrieval |
| Criteria coverage | % of required criteria marked strong |
| Snippet fitness | % of intents with high-quality selected snippets |
| Fact integrity | Count of critical contradictions unresolved |
| Discovery success | % of tasks completed by autonomous exploration |
| Citation stability | Variance in citation frequency over repeated runs |
| Site-query readiness | % of priority pages retrievable via `site:yourdomain.com [category]` |
| Third-party profile currency | % of review platform profiles updated within last 90 days |

## Prioritization Rules

- Fix critical fact contradictions before expanding content
- Prioritize pages that already rank and convert
- Prefer focused section updates before creating new URLs
- Keep evidence traceable for every important claim
- Re-validate key pages after major model updates or indexing shifts
