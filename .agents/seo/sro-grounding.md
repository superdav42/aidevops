# SRO Grounding

Selection Rate Optimization (SRO) focuses on whether a source gets selected into grounded context, not only whether it ranks.

## Quick Reference

- Purpose: improve source selection share in AI retrieval pipelines
- Core metric: Selection Rate (selected appearances / available retrieval opportunities)
- Inputs: query themes, ranked pages, extracted snippets, page structure and copy
- Outputs: snippet optimization recommendations, structural cleanup, SRO test plan

## Working Model

- AI retrieval often works with fixed context budgets
- Top-ranked and higher-relevance sources usually receive larger context share
- Long pages can suffer low content survival if key facts are buried

## SRO Workflow

### 1) Baseline snippet extraction behavior

- Collect snippets selected for representative intents
- Tag snippet type: lead paragraph, list item, heading-adjacent sentence, table row
- Identify what wins repeatedly and what never survives

### 2) Improve snippet fitness

- Rewrite critical statements as standalone, factual sentences
- Move essential facts closer to top-of-page sections
- Reduce dependency on surrounding context to interpret a sentence

### 3) Reduce structural noise

- Minimize repetitive boilerplate near top content blocks
- Keep heading hierarchy clean and predictable
- Avoid decorative text that competes with factual statements

### 4) Cover fan-out angles

- For each intent, map related sub-questions that retrieval systems may dispatch
- Ensure target page contains concise answers for each major angle
- Add internal links to deeper evidence where required

### 5) Validate with controlled re-tests

- Re-run the same intent set after updates
- Compare selected snippet quality, coverage breadth, and citation persistence
- Keep an SRO changelog tied to page revisions
- Re-test after index and model updates because grounding behavior is transient

## Content Rules for High Selection Likelihood

- Put key eligibility facts in opening sections
- Prefer short declarative sentences over vague promotional phrasing
- Keep numerics and qualifiers explicit (thresholds, limits, timelines)
- Use lists/tables only when they preserve factual precision
- Keep policy, pricing, and capability statements up to date
- Refresh critical sections on a defined cadence to preserve snippet freshness

## Common Failure Modes

- Important claims appear only deep in the page
- Contradictory facts across pages dilute confidence
- Overlong narrative sections bury actionable information
- Snippet candidates rely on pronouns and missing antecedents
