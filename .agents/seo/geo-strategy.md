# GEO Strategy

Design and evaluate AI search optimization strategy with a retrieval-first approach.

## Quick Reference

- Purpose: increase citation likelihood in AI search by matching decision criteria with verifiable page content
- Primary outcome: better AI retrieval fit on pages that already rank in traditional search
- Inputs: core query set, top landing pages, competitor set, proof assets (certifications, policies, prices, case evidence)
- Outputs: criteria matrix, page gap map, prioritized implementation plan

## Positioning

- Use GEO as an operational label, not a replacement for SEO
- Treat ranking as prerequisite: if page does not rank, it cannot be consistently cited
- Optimize for deterministic retrieval signals, not daily answer volatility

## Workflow

### 1) Scope high-value intents

- Select 5-20 intents that influence revenue or lead quality
- Map each intent to an existing target page
- Exclude intents without a realistic ranking path yet
- Classify intents by grounding likelihood to avoid optimizing non-retrieval prompts

### 2) Extract decision criteria

- Probe multiple models with targeted buying-decision prompts
- Normalize outputs into concrete criteria (not vague advice)
- Cluster by category: trust, expertise, fit, cost, delivery, risk

### 3) Score coverage per page

- For each criterion, mark page state: strong, partial, missing, not applicable
- Require evidence references (URL section, data source, policy, certification)
- Flag unsupported marketing claims immediately

### 4) Build retrieval-ready summaries

- Add a concise criteria-matching block near top of page
- Keep claims specific and self-contained
- Prefer facts with provenance over broad brand language

### 5) Validate and iterate

- Re-check retrieval fitness after edits
- Monitor citations directionally, but evaluate by coverage and consistency first
- Re-run criteria extraction monthly or after major model shifts
- Watch citation confidence and volatility, not only mention count

## Implementation Rules

- Keep the first 200-300 words highly informative and criteria-dense
- Use explicit headings for key buyer concerns
- Keep terminology aligned with user query vocabulary and synonyms
- Keep a single canonical value for every critical fact across the site
- Prefer additive edits to existing pages before creating net-new pages
- Ensure key pages remain accessible to major AI/search crawlers

## Anti-Patterns

- Prompt-rank dashboards without content remediation
- Large batches of AI-generated pages with weak evidence
- Generic "best" claims without supporting proof
- Treating one model's output snapshot as durable ground truth
