# GEO Strategy

Design and evaluate AI search visibility with a retrieval-first approach.

- Purpose: increase citation likelihood in AI search by matching decision criteria with verifiable page content
- Primary outcome: better AI retrieval fit on pages that already rank in traditional search
- Inputs: core query set, top landing pages, competitor set, proof assets (certifications, policies, prices, case evidence)
- Outputs: criteria matrix, page gap map, prioritized implementation plan
- GEO is an operational label, not a replacement for SEO
- Ranking is prerequisite — unranked pages cannot be consistently cited
- Optimize for deterministic retrieval signals, not daily answer volatility

## Workflow

### 1) Scope high-value intents

- Select 5-20 intents that influence revenue or lead quality
- Map each intent to an existing target page
- Exclude intents without a realistic ranking path
- Classify intents by grounding likelihood to avoid optimizing non-retrieval prompts

### 2) Extract decision criteria

- Probe multiple models with targeted buying-decision prompts
- Normalize outputs into concrete criteria (not vague advice)
- Cluster by category: trust, expertise, fit, cost, delivery, risk

### 3) Score coverage per page

- For each criterion, mark page state: strong, partial, missing, or not applicable
- Require evidence references (URL section, data source, policy, certification)
- Flag unsupported marketing claims immediately

### 4) Build retrieval-ready summaries

- Add a concise criteria-matching block near top of page
- Keep claims specific and self-contained
- Prefer facts with provenance over broad brand language

### 5) Validate and iterate

- Re-check retrieval fitness after edits
- Evaluate coverage and consistency before citation counts
- Monitor citations directionally, not as the only success metric
- Re-run criteria extraction monthly or after major model shifts

## Anti-Patterns

- Prompt-rank dashboards without content remediation
- Large batches of AI-generated pages with weak evidence
- Generic "best" claims without supporting proof
- Treating one model's output snapshot as durable ground truth

## Implementation Rules

- First 200-300 words must be criteria-dense and informative
- Use explicit headings for key buyer concerns; align terminology with user query vocabulary
- Single canonical value for every critical fact across the site
- Prefer additive edits to existing pages before creating net-new pages
- Keep key pages accessible to major AI/search crawlers

### Domain-scoped retrieval

AI models use `site:yourdomain.com` queries to extract detail from domains already identified as relevant:

- Pages must return results for `site:yourdomain.com [category] features [year]` patterns
- One topic per URL; avoid consolidating all product info into a single page
- Titles, H1s, and headings must include category terms, feature type, year, and pricing where applicable
- Keep pricing, feature lists, and comparison data in crawlable HTML — not behind JS rendering or gated forms

### Review platform parity

AI models query G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius as a validation stage after extracting brand-site claims:

- Maintain complete profiles with the same canonical facts (pricing, features, integrations) as the primary site
- Consistent product naming and categorization across platforms; wrong category = invisible to model queries
- Respond to reviews — AI models may extract vendor responses as support quality evidence
- Monitor profiles quarterly; add TrustRadius, PeerSpot, or vertical-specific sites where G2/Capterra coverage is thin
