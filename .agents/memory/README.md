# Memory System

Cross-session memory for AI assistants using SQLite FTS5 for fast full-text search.

**Requires**: `sqlite3` CLI (includes FTS5 by default)

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install sqlite3

# macOS (usually pre-installed)
brew install sqlite3

# Verify installation
sqlite3 --version
```

**Motto**: "Compound, then clear" - Sessions should build on each other.

**Inspired by**: [Supermemory](https://supermemory.ai/research) architecture for:

- **Relational versioning** - Track how memories evolve (updates, extends, derives)
- **Dual timestamps** - Distinguish when stored vs when event occurred
- **Contextual disambiguation** - Self-contained, atomic memories

**Architecture Decision: SQLite FTS5 over PostgreSQL** - SQLite was chosen for memory storage to minimize deployment complexity and eliminate external dependencies. No separate database server required, no connection management, and FTS5 provides fast full-text search out of the box. This aligns with the aidevops philosophy of self-contained, portable tooling.

## Entity Memory System

The memory system extends beyond project-scoped learnings to include **entity memory** — tracking relationships with people, agents, and services across all communication channels. This enables relationship continuity that survives session resets and context compaction.

**Architecture:** Three-layer design sharing the same `memory.db` database. See `reference/entity-memory-architecture.md` for the full architecture document.

| Layer | Purpose | Script | Tables |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Layer 0 | Raw interaction log (immutable, append-only) | `entity-helper.sh` | `interactions`, `interactions_fts` |
| Layer 1 | Per-conversation context (tactical summaries) | `conversation-helper.sh` | `conversations`, `conversation_summaries` |
| Layer 2 | Entity relationship model (strategic profiles) | `entity-helper.sh` | `entities`, `entity_channels`, `entity_profiles`, `capability_gaps` |
| Loop | Self-evolution (gap detection → TODO → upgrade) | `self-evolution-helper.sh` | `capability_gaps`, `gap_evidence` |

**Key concepts:**

- **Entities** — people, agents, or services the system interacts with
- **Cross-channel identity** — link Matrix, SimpleX, email, CLI identities to the same entity (with confidence levels: confirmed/suggested/inferred)
- **Versioned profiles** — entity preferences and needs are never updated in place; new versions supersede old ones via `supersedes_id` chain
- **Immutable interactions** — Layer 0 is append-only; all other layers are derived from it
- **Self-evolution loop** — interaction patterns → capability gap detection → automatic TODO creation → system upgrade → better service

**Quick entity examples:**

```bash
# Create an entity with initial channel link
entity-helper.sh create --name "Marcus" --type person \
    --channel matrix --channel-id "@marcus:server.com"

# Link additional channel
entity-helper.sh link ent_xxx --channel email \
    --channel-id "marcus@example.com" --verified

# Log an interaction (Layer 0 — immutable)
entity-helper.sh log-interaction ent_xxx \
    --channel matrix --content "How's the deployment going?"

# Create a conversation and load context
conversation-helper.sh create --entity ent_xxx --channel matrix \
    --channel-id "!room:server" --topic "Deployment discussion"
conversation-helper.sh context conv_xxx --recent-messages 10

# Store a memory linked to an entity
memory-helper.sh store --content "Prefers concise responses" \
    --entity ent_xxx --type USER_PREFERENCE

# Recall memories for an entity
memory-helper.sh recall --query "preferences" --entity ent_xxx

# Run self-evolution scan
self-evolution-helper.sh pulse-scan --auto-todo-threshold 3
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Store a memory
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh store --type "WORKING_SOLUTION" --content "Fixed CORS with nginx headers" --tags "cors,nginx"

# Store with event date (when it happened, not when stored)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh store --content "Deployed v2.0" --event-date "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"

# Update an existing memory (creates version chain)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh store --content "Favorite color is now green" --supersedes mem_xxx --relation updates

# View version history
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh history mem_xxx

# Store an auto-captured memory (from AI agent)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh store --auto --type "WORKING_SOLUTION" --content "Fixed CORS with nginx headers" --tags "cors,nginx"

# Recall memories
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh recall "cors"

# Show recent memories
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh recall --recent

# Show auto-capture log
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh log

# View statistics (includes auto-capture counts)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh stats

# Remove duplicate memories
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh dedup --dry-run
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh dedup

# Validate memory health (staleness, duplicates, size)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh validate
```

## Auto-Recall

Memories are automatically recalled at key entry points to provide relevant context:

**Interactive Sessions:**
- **Session start**: Recent memories (last 5) surface via `conversation-starter.md`
- **Session resume**: After loading checkpoint, recent memories provide context

**Headless Workers:**
- **Runner dispatch**: Before task execution, runners recall:
  - Recent memories (last 5) from runner's namespace
  - Task-specific memories based on prompt query
- **Objective runner**: On first step only (token efficiency), recalls:
  - Recent memories (last 5)
  - Objective-specific memories based on goal description
  - Failure patterns from previous runs of the same objective

**Behavior:**
- Silent if no memories found (no noise)
- Uses namespace isolation for runners (`--namespace <name> --shared`)
- Formatted as markdown sections prepended to prompts
- Only runs once per entry point (not on every iteration)

**Implementation:**
- `conversation-starter.md`: Lines 10-24 (interactive session start)
- `session-checkpoint-helper.sh`: `cmd_load()` (session resume)
- `runner-helper.sh`: `cmd_run()` (runner dispatch)
- `objective-runner-helper.sh`: archived (t1336) — `/full-loop` now handles iterative execution

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/remember {content}` | Store a memory with AI-assisted categorization |
| `/recall {query}` | Search memories by keyword |
| `/recall --recent` | Show 10 most recent memories |
| `/recall --auto-only` | Search only auto-captured memories |
| `/recall --stats` | Show memory statistics |
| `/memory-log` | Show recent auto-captured memories |

See `scripts/commands/remember.md` and `scripts/commands/recall.md` for full documentation.

## Memory Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `WORKING_SOLUTION` | Fixes that worked |
| `FAILED_APPROACH` | What didn't work (avoid repeating) |
| `CODEBASE_PATTERN` | Project conventions |
| `USER_PREFERENCE` | Developer preferences |
| `TOOL_CONFIG` | Tool setup notes |
| `DECISION` | General project decisions and non-architectural choices |
| `CONTEXT` | Background info |
| `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION` | System-level architecture choices and trade-offs (service boundaries, data flow, tech stack selection) |
| `ERROR_FIX` | Bug fixes and patches |
| `OPEN_THREAD` | Unresolved questions or follow-ups |
| `SUCCESS_PATTERN` | Approaches that consistently work for task types |
| `FAILURE_PATTERN` | Approaches that consistently fail for task types |

## Auto-Capture

AI agents automatically store memories using the `--auto` flag when they detect
significant events (working solutions, failed approaches, decisions). This is
tool-agnostic - works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Windsurf, or any AI
tool that reads AGENTS.md.

**How it works:**

1. Agent detects a trigger (e.g., solution found, preference stated)
2. Agent stores with `--auto` flag: `memory-helper.sh store --auto --content "..."`
3. Auto-captured memories are tracked separately from manual `/remember` entries
4. Review with `/memory-log` or `memory-helper.sh log`

**Privacy filters (applied automatically on store):**

- `<private>...</private>` blocks are stripped from content
- Content matching secret patterns (API keys, tokens) is rejected
- Credentials and sensitive config values are never stored

**Filtering:**

```bash
# Show only auto-captured memories
memory-helper.sh recall "query" --auto-only

# Show only manually stored memories
memory-helper.sh recall "query" --manual-only

# Show auto-capture log (recent auto-captures)
memory-helper.sh log
memory-helper.sh log --limit 50
```

## Relation Types

Inspired by Supermemory's relational versioning:

| Relation | Use For | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `updates` | New info supersedes old (state mutation) | "Favorite color is now green" updates "...is blue" |
| `extends` | Adds detail without contradiction | Adding job title to existing employment memory |
| `derives` | Second-order inference from combining | Inferring "works remotely" from location + job info |

## Dual Timestamps

| Timestamp | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `created_at` | When the memory was stored in the database |
| `event_date` | When the event described actually occurred |

This enables temporal reasoning like "what happened last week?" by distinguishing
between when you learned something vs when it happened.

## Deduplication

The memory system prevents duplicate entries at two levels:

**On store (automatic):** Before inserting a new memory, the system checks for:

- **Exact duplicates**: identical content string with the same type
- **Near-duplicates**: same content after normalizing case, punctuation, and whitespace

When a duplicate is detected, the existing entry's access count is incremented and its ID is returned. No new entry is created.

**Bulk deduplication:** For cleaning up existing duplicates:

```bash
# Preview what would be removed
memory-helper.sh dedup --dry-run

# Remove all duplicates (keeps oldest, merges tags)
memory-helper.sh dedup

# Only remove exact duplicates (skip near-duplicates)
memory-helper.sh dedup --exact-only
```

## Auto-Pruning

Stale entries are automatically pruned to keep the memory database lean:

- **Trigger**: Runs opportunistically on every `store` call (at most once per 24 hours)
- **Criteria**: Removes entries older than 90 days that have never been accessed
- **Safe**: Frequently accessed memories are preserved regardless of age
- **Manual override**: Use `prune` command for custom thresholds

```bash
# Manual prune with custom threshold
memory-helper.sh prune --older-than-days 60

# Preview before pruning
memory-helper.sh prune --older-than-days 60 --dry-run

# Also prune accessed entries (use with caution)
memory-helper.sh prune --older-than-days 180 --include-accessed
```

## Semantic Search (Opt-in)

For similarity-based search beyond keyword matching, enable vector embeddings:

```bash
# One-time setup with local model (~90MB download, no API key)
memory-embeddings-helper.sh setup --provider local

# Or use OpenAI API (requires API key, no local model download)
memory-embeddings-helper.sh setup --provider openai

# Index existing memories
memory-embeddings-helper.sh index

# Search by meaning (not just keywords)
memory-helper.sh recall "how to optimize database queries" --semantic

# Hybrid search: combines FTS5 keyword + semantic using Reciprocal Rank Fusion
memory-helper.sh recall "authentication patterns" --hybrid

# Or use the embeddings helper directly
memory-embeddings-helper.sh search "authentication patterns"
memory-embeddings-helper.sh search "authentication patterns" --hybrid

# Check provider and index status
memory-embeddings-helper.sh status

# Switch between providers
memory-embeddings-helper.sh provider openai
memory-embeddings-helper.sh rebuild  # Re-index with new provider
```

### Embedding Providers

| Provider | Model | Dimensions | Requirements |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| `local` | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | Python 3.9+, sentence-transformers (~90MB) |
| `openai` | text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | Python 3.9+, numpy, OpenAI API key |

### Search Modes

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Keyword (default) | (none) | FTS5 BM25 full-text search |
| Semantic | `--semantic` | Vector similarity search |
| Hybrid | `--hybrid` | Combines keyword + semantic using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) |

Hybrid search is recommended for natural language queries. It finds results that
match by both exact keywords and semantic meaning, producing better results than
either method alone.

### Auto-Indexing

Once embeddings are configured (`setup` + `index`), new memories stored via
`memory-helper.sh store` are automatically indexed in the background. No manual
re-indexing is needed for new entries.

FTS5 keyword search remains the default and works without any setup.

## Pattern Tracking

Track what works and what fails across task types, models, and approaches.
Patterns are captured automatically by the supervisor after task completion,
and can also be recorded manually.

Pattern tracking is now handled by the cross-session memory system and the pulse supervisor's outcome observation (Step 2a). Use `/remember` and `/recall` for manual pattern recording, and slash commands for querying:

```bash
# Use slash commands for pattern queries
/patterns refactor          # Suggest patterns for a task
/patterns report            # Full report
/patterns recommend bugfix  # Model recommendation
/route "fix auth bug"       # Model routing (includes pattern data)

# Manual pattern recording via memory
/remember "Structured debugging found root cause for bugfix t102.3 (sonnet, 120s)"
/recall "bugfix patterns"
```

**Automatic capture**: The pulse supervisor observes success/failure patterns from GitHub PR state (merged vs closed-without-merge) and files improvement issues when patterns emerge. Agents also record patterns via `/remember` after task completion.

> **Note**: The `pattern-tracker-helper.sh` script has been archived. Pattern data in `memory.db` remains accessible via the memory system. See `scripts/archived/pattern-tracker-helper.sh` for the original implementation.

## Memory Graduation (Sharing Learnings)

Graduate validated local memories into shared documentation so all framework users
benefit. Memories qualify when they reach high confidence or are accessed frequently.

```bash
# Check graduation status
memory-graduate-helper.sh status

# See what's ready to graduate
memory-graduate-helper.sh candidates

# Preview graduation output
memory-graduate-helper.sh graduate --dry-run

# Graduate memories into shared docs
memory-graduate-helper.sh graduate

# Or use via memory-helper.sh
memory-helper.sh graduate candidates
memory-helper.sh graduate status
```

**How it works**:

1. Memories accumulate in local DB via `/remember` and auto-capture
2. Frequently recalled memories gain `access_count` (proves usefulness)
3. `memory-graduate-helper.sh candidates` shows what qualifies
4. `memory-graduate-helper.sh graduate` appends to `.agents/aidevops/graduated-learnings.md`
5. Graduated memories are marked with `graduated_at` timestamp (won't be proposed again)
6. Commit and push the updated file to share with all users

**Graduation criteria** (any of):

- `confidence = "high"` (manually marked as high-value)
- `access_count >= 3` (frequently recalled, proving usefulness)

**Slash command**: `/graduate-memories` or `/graduate-memories --dry-run`

See `scripts/memory-graduate-helper.sh help` for full documentation.

## Memory Audit Pulse (Automated Hygiene)

Periodic scan that deduplicates, prunes, graduates, and identifies improvement
opportunities. Runs automatically as Phase 9 of the supervisor pulse cycle
(self-throttled to once per 24 hours).

```bash
# Run audit pulse manually
memory-audit-pulse.sh run --force

# Preview without changes
memory-audit-pulse.sh run --dry-run

# Check audit history
memory-audit-pulse.sh status
```

**Phases**:

1. **Dedup** — remove exact and near-duplicate memories
2. **Prune** — remove stale entries (>90 days, never accessed)
3. **Graduate** — promote high-value memories to shared docs
4. **Scan** — identify self-improvement opportunities (recurring failures, noisy auto-capture, untagged memories)
5. **Report** — summary with JSONL history

**Cron integration** (optional):

```bash
# Daily at 4 AM
0 4 * * * ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-audit-pulse.sh run --quiet
```

**Slash command**: `/memory-audit` or `/memory-audit --dry-run`

See `scripts/memory-audit-pulse.sh help` for full documentation.

## Namespaces (Per-Runner Memory Isolation)

Runners can have isolated memory namespaces. Each namespace gets its own SQLite DB,
preventing cross-contamination between parallel agents while allowing shared access
to global memories when needed.

```bash
# Store in a runner-specific namespace
memory-helper.sh --namespace code-reviewer store --content "Prefer explicit error handling"

# Recall from namespace only
memory-helper.sh --namespace code-reviewer recall "error handling"

# Recall from namespace + global (shared access)
memory-helper.sh --namespace code-reviewer recall "error handling" --shared

# View namespace stats
memory-helper.sh --namespace code-reviewer stats

# List all namespaces
memory-helper.sh namespaces
```

Namespace DBs are stored at `memory/namespaces/<name>/memory.db`. The global DB
remains at `memory/memory.db` and is always accessible without `--namespace`.

## Entity Memory (Relationship Continuity)

Entity memory gives agents the ability to maintain relationship continuity with
individuals across all channels (Matrix, SimpleX, email, CLI). It extends the
existing project-scoped memory with a three-layer architecture for tracking
entities (people, agents, services) and their interactions.

**Full architecture**: `reference/entity-memory-architecture.md`

### Three Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Script | Mutability |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| Layer 0 | Raw interaction log | `entity-helper.sh log-interaction` | **Immutable** (append-only) |
| Layer 1 | Per-conversation context | `conversation-helper.sh` | Summaries immutable (supersedes chain) |
| Layer 2 | Entity relationship model | `entity-helper.sh` | Profiles immutable (supersedes chain) |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create an entity with initial channel link
entity-helper.sh create --name "Marcus" --type person \
    --channel matrix --channel-id "@marcus:server.com"

# Link additional channel identity
entity-helper.sh link ent_xxx --channel email \
    --channel-id "marcus@example.com" --verified

# Suggest matches for an unknown identity
entity-helper.sh suggest simplex "~user123"

# Log an interaction (Layer 0 — immutable)
entity-helper.sh log-interaction ent_xxx \
    --channel matrix --content "How's the deployment going?"

# Create a conversation and add messages
conversation-helper.sh create --entity ent_xxx --channel matrix \
    --channel-id "!room:server" --topic "Deployment"
conversation-helper.sh add-message conv_xxx --content "All green!"

# Load context for an AI model (combines all three layers)
conversation-helper.sh context conv_xxx --recent-messages 20

# Update entity profile (versioned — creates new entry, supersedes old)
entity-helper.sh profile-update ent_xxx \
    --key "communication_style" --value "prefers concise responses" \
    --evidence "observed across 5 conversations"

# Generate conversation summary (immutable, with source range refs)
conversation-helper.sh summarise conv_xxx

# AI-judged idle detection (replaces fixed timeout)
conversation-helper.sh idle-check --all

# View entity context (privacy-filtered)
entity-helper.sh context ent_xxx --privacy-filter --limit 10

# Entity system statistics
entity-helper.sh stats
```

### Identity Resolution

Cross-channel identity linking follows a "suggest, don't assume" principle:

- **`suggest`**: Proposes entity matches for an unknown channel identity
- **`link`**: Creates a link (defaults to `suggested` confidence)
- **`link --verified`**: Creates a confirmed link
- **`verify`**: Upgrades an existing link to `confirmed`

Confidence levels: `confirmed` (user verified) > `suggested` (system proposed) > `inferred` (pattern match).

### Immutability Guarantees

- **Interactions** (Layer 0): Never updated or deleted. Append-only source of truth.
- **Summaries** (Layer 1): Never edited. New summaries supersede old ones via `supersedes_id`.
- **Profiles** (Layer 2): Never updated in place. Each change creates a new version with evidence.

This ensures a complete audit trail of how the system's understanding of each entity evolved over time.

### Self-Evolution Loop

The capability gap system detects what users need but the system cannot provide:

```bash
# Gaps are detected during interactions and recorded with evidence
# High-frequency gaps are promoted to TODO tasks automatically
# Resolution is tracked: detected → todo_created → resolved
```

See `reference/entity-memory-architecture.md` for the full self-evolution loop design.
