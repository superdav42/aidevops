E-E-A-T Score Helper - Content Quality Analysis

Usage: eeat-score-helper.sh [command] [input] [options]

Commands:
  analyze <crawl-data>  Analyze pages from site-crawler output
  score <url>           Score a single URL
  batch <urls-file>     Batch analyze URLs from a file
  report <scores-file>  Generate report from existing scores
  status                Check dependencies and configuration
  help                  Show this help message

Options:
  --output <dir>        Output directory (default: ~/Downloads)
  --format <fmt>        Output format: csv, xlsx, all (default: xlsx)
  --provider <name>     LLM provider: openai, anthropic (default: openai)
  --model <name>        LLM model (default: gpt-4o)
  --verbose             Show detailed output

Examples:
  # Analyze crawled pages
  eeat-score-helper.sh analyze ~/Downloads/example.com/_latest/crawl-data.json

  # Score single URL
  eeat-score-helper.sh score https://example.com/blog/article

  # Batch analyze
  eeat-score-helper.sh batch urls.txt --format xlsx

  # Check status
  eeat-score-helper.sh status

Output Structure:
  ~/Downloads/{domain}/{timestamp}/
    - {domain}-eeat-score-{date}.xlsx   E-E-A-T scores with reasoning
    - {domain}-eeat-score-{date}.csv    Same data in CSV format
    - eeat-summary.json                 Summary statistics

  ~/Downloads/{domain}/_latest -> symlink to latest analysis
