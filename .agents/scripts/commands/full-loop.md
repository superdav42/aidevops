Start a full development loop that chains all phases from task implementation to deployment.

Task/Prompt: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 0: Resolve Task ID and Set Session Title

**IMPORTANT**: Before proceeding, extract the first positional argument from `$ARGUMENTS` (ignoring flags like `--max-task-iterations`). Check if it matches the task ID pattern `t\d+` (e.g., `t061`).

**Supervisor dispatch format (t158)**: When dispatched by the supervisor, the prompt may include the task description inline: `/full-loop t061 -- Fix the login bug`. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains ` -- `, everything after ` -- ` is the task description provided by the supervisor. Use it directly instead of looking up TODO.md.

If the first argument is a task ID (e.g., `t061`):

1. Extract the task ID and resolve its description using this priority chain:

   ```bash
   # Extract first argument (the task ID)
   TASK_ID=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | awk '{print $1}')

   # Priority 1: Inline description from supervisor dispatch (after " -- ")
   TASK_DESC=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | sed -n 's/.*-- //p')

   # Priority 2: Look up from TODO.md
   if [[ -z "$TASK_DESC" ]]; then
       TASK_DESC=$(grep -E "^- \[( |x|-)\] $TASK_ID " TODO.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed -E 's/^- \[( |x|-)\] [^ ]* //')
   fi

   # Priority 3: Query GitHub issues (for dynamically-created tasks not yet in TODO.md)
   if [[ -z "$TASK_DESC" ]]; then
       TASK_DESC=$(gh issue list --repo "$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null)" \
           --search "$TASK_ID" --json title -q '.[0].title' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   fi
   ```

2. Set the session title using the `session-rename` MCP tool:

   ```text
   # Call the session-rename tool with the title parameter
   session-rename(title: "t061: Improve session title to include task description")
   ```

   - Good: `"t061: Improve session title to include task description"`
   - Bad: `"Full loop development for t061"`

3. **Fallback**: If `$TASK_DESC` is still empty after all lookups, use: `"t061: (task not found)"`

4. Store the full task description for use in subsequent steps.

If the first argument is NOT a task ID (it's a description):
- Use the description directly for the session title
- Call `session-rename` tool with a concise version if the description is very long (truncate to ~60 chars)
- **Extract issue number if present (#2452 fix):** If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `issue #NNN` or `Issue #NNN`, extract the issue number for the OPEN state check in Step 0.6. Store it as `$ISSUE_NUM` so the state check fires even without a task ID:

  ```bash
  # Extract issue number from supervisor dispatch format: "Implement issue #2452 ..."
  # Use portable sed (POSIX) — grep -oP is GNU-only and fails on macOS/BSD
  ISSUE_NUM=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | sed -En 's/.*[Ii][Ss][Ss][Uu][Ee][[:space:]]*#*([0-9]+).*/\1/p' | head -1)
  ```

**Example session titles:**
- Task ID `t061` with description "Improve session title format" → `"t061: Improve session title format"`
- Task ID `t061` with supervisor inline `-- Fix login bug` → `"t061: Fix login bug"`
- Task ID `t999` not found anywhere → `"t999: (task not found)"`
- Description "Add JWT authentication" → `"Add JWT authentication"`

## Full Loop Phases

```text
Claim → Branch Setup → Task Development → Preflight → PR Create → PR Review → Postflight → Deploy
```

## Lifecycle Completeness Gate (t5096 + GH#5317 — MANDATORY)

**Two distinct failure modes exist. Both are equally fatal:**

**Failure mode 1 (GH#5317):** Worker exits after implementation WITHOUT committing or creating a PR. Files left uncommitted in the worktree. The supervisor cannot detect or recover uncommitted work. This is the earlier failure — it happens before PR creation.

**Failure mode 2 (GH#5096):** Worker exits after PR creation WITHOUT completing the post-PR lifecycle (review, merge, release, cleanup). The PR sits unmerged indefinitely.

**The full lifecycle in order — do NOT skip any step:**

0. **Commit+PR gate (GH#5317)** — At the end of implementation in Step 3, verify all changes are committed (`git status --porcelain` is empty) and create/confirm the PR. Only after this gate passes may `TASK_COMPLETE` be emitted. (`TASK_COMPLETE` now means: implementation done + all changes committed + PR exists.)
1. **Review bot gate** — wait for CodeRabbit/Gemini/Copilot reviews (poll up to 10 min)
2. **Address critical findings** — fix security/critical issues from bot reviews
3. **Merge** — `gh pr merge --squash` (without `--delete-branch` in worktrees)
4. **Auto-release** — bump patch version + create GitHub release (aidevops repo only)
5. **Issue closing comment** — post a structured comment on every linked issue
6. **Worktree cleanup** — return to main, pull, prune merged worktrees

**Do NOT emit `FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE` until step 0 through step 6 are done.** If you stop at implementation without a PR, or stop at PR creation without merging, the task is incomplete. (`TASK_COMPLETE` = implementation + commit/PR gate complete; `FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE` = all 7 steps complete.)

This gate applies regardless of how you were dispatched (pulse, `/runners`, bare `opencode run`, or interactive). See Step 4 below for the full details of each phase.

## Workflow

### Step 0.45: Task Decomposition Check (t1408.2)

Before claiming and starting work, classify the task to determine if it should be decomposed into subtasks. This catches over-scoped tasks before a worker spends hours on something that should be multiple focused PRs.

**When to run:** After resolving the task description (Step 0) and before claiming (Step 0.5). Skip if `--no-decompose` flag is passed or if the task already has subtasks in TODO.md.

**How it works:**

```bash
DECOMPOSE_HELPER="$HOME/.aidevops/agents/scripts/task-decompose-helper.sh"

# Only run if the helper exists (t1408.1 must be merged)
if [[ -x "$DECOMPOSE_HELPER" && -n "$TASK_ID" ]]; then
  # Check if subtasks already exist (returns "true" or "false")
  HAS_SUBS=$(/bin/bash "$DECOMPOSE_HELPER" has-subtasks "$TASK_ID") || HAS_SUBS="false"

  if [[ "$HAS_SUBS" == "true" ]]; then
    # Subtasks already exist — skip decomposition
    echo "[t1408.2] Task $TASK_ID already has subtasks — proceeding with implementation"
  else
    # No existing subtasks — classify the task description
    CLASSIFY=$(/bin/bash "$DECOMPOSE_HELPER" classify "$TASK_DESC" --depth 0) || CLASSIFY=""
    TASK_KIND=$(echo "$CLASSIFY" | jq -r '.kind // "atomic"' || echo "atomic")
  fi
fi
```

**If atomic (or helper unavailable):** Proceed to Step 0.5 (claim and implement directly). This is the default path — most tasks are atomic.

**If composite — interactive mode:**

Show the decomposition tree and ask for confirmation:

```bash
DECOMPOSE=$(/bin/bash "$DECOMPOSE_HELPER" decompose "$TASK_DESC" --max-subtasks "${DECOMPOSE_MAX_SUBTASKS:-5}") || DECOMPOSE=""
SUBTASK_COUNT=$(echo "$DECOMPOSE" | jq '.subtasks | length' || echo 0)
```

Present to the user:

```text
This task appears to be composite (contains 2+ independent concerns).
Suggested decomposition:

1. {subtask_1_description} (~{estimate})
2. {subtask_2_description} (~{estimate}) [depends on: 1]
3. {subtask_3_description} (~{estimate})

Options:
  Y - Create subtasks and dispatch them separately (recommended)
  n - Implement as a single task anyway
  e - Edit the decomposition before creating subtasks
```

If the user confirms (Y):

1. Create child task IDs using `claim-task-id.sh` for each subtask
2. Add child entries to TODO.md with `blocked-by:` edges from the decomposition
3. Create briefs for each child task (inheriting parent context + subtask-specific scope)
4. Label the parent task `status:blocked` with `blocked-by:` refs to children
5. Ask: "Implement the first leaf task now, or queue all for dispatch?"

**If composite — headless mode:**

Auto-decompose without confirmation (the pulse already classified this as composite):

1. Create child tasks, briefs, and TODO entries automatically
2. Label parent as `status:blocked`
3. Exit cleanly with: `DECOMPOSED: task $TASK_ID split into $SUBTASK_COUNT subtasks ($CHILD_IDS). Parent blocked. Children queued for dispatch.`
4. The next pulse cycle dispatches the leaf tasks

**Depth limit:** Controlled by `DECOMPOSE_MAX_DEPTH` env var (default: 3). At depth 3+, tasks are always treated as atomic regardless of classification.

### Step 0.5: Claim Task (t1017)

If the first argument is a task ID (`t\d+`), claim it before starting work. This prevents two agents (or a human and an agent) from working on the same task concurrently.

```bash
# Claim the task — adds assignee:<identity> started:<ISO> to TODO.md task line
# Uses git pull → grep assignee: → add fields → commit + push
# Race protection: git push rejection = someone else claimed first
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Claimed successfully (or already claimed by you) — proceed
- `1` - Claimed by someone else — **STOP, do not start work**

**If claim fails** (task is claimed by another contributor):
- In interactive mode: inform the user and stop
- In headless mode: exit cleanly with `BLOCKED: task claimed by assignee:{name}`

**Skip claim when:**
- The first argument is not a task ID (it's a description)
- The `--no-claim` flag is passed

### Step 0.6: Update Issue Label — `status:in-progress`

After claiming the task, update the linked GitHub issue label to reflect that work has started. This gives at-a-glance visibility into which tasks have active workers.

```bash
# Find the linked issue number — check multiple sources (#2452 fix):
# 1. Already extracted from "issue #NNN" in arguments (Step 0)
# 2. Extract from TODO.md ref:GH#NNN (authoritative — set during task creation)
if [[ -z "$ISSUE_NUM" || "$ISSUE_NUM" == "null" ]] && [[ -n "$TASK_ID" ]]; then
  ISSUE_NUM=$(grep -E "^\s*-\s*\[.\]\s*${TASK_ID}[[:space:]]" TODO.md 2>/dev/null \
    | sed -En 's/.*ref:GH#([0-9]+).*/\1/p' | head -1)
fi
# 3. Fallback: search GitHub issues by task ID prefix
if [[ -z "$ISSUE_NUM" || "$ISSUE_NUM" == "null" ]] && [[ -n "$TASK_ID" ]]; then
  ISSUE_NUM=$(gh issue list --repo "$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)" \
    --state open --search "${TASK_ID}:" --json number,title --limit 5 \
    | jq -r --arg tid "$TASK_ID" '[.[] | select(.title | test("^" + $tid + "[.:\\s]"))] | .[0].number // empty' 2>/dev/null || true)
fi

if [[ -n "$ISSUE_NUM" && "$ISSUE_NUM" != "null" ]]; then
  REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)

  # t1343 + #2452: Check issue state — if CLOSED, abort the entire worker session.
  # This is the worker-side defense against being dispatched for a closed issue.
  # The supervisor checks OPEN state before dispatch (scripts/commands/pulse.md Step 3), but if
  # the issue was closed between dispatch and worker startup, catch it here.
  ISSUE_STATE=$(gh issue view "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --json state -q .state 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
  if [[ "$ISSUE_STATE" != "OPEN" ]]; then
    echo "[t1343/#2452] Issue #$ISSUE_NUM state is $ISSUE_STATE (not OPEN) — aborting worker"
    echo "ABORTED: Issue #$ISSUE_NUM is $ISSUE_STATE. Nothing to implement."
    # In headless mode, exit cleanly. In interactive mode, inform the user.
    exit 0
  else
    # Self-assign to prevent duplicate work by other runners/humans
    WORKER_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login' 2>/dev/null || whoami)
    gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --add-assignee "$WORKER_USER" --add-label "status:in-progress" 2>/dev/null || true
    for STALE in "status:available" "status:queued" "status:claimed"; do
      gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --remove-label "$STALE" 2>/dev/null || true
    done
  fi
fi
```

**Label and assignment lifecycle** — labels and GitHub issue assignees work together to coordinate work across multiple machines and contributors:

| Label | Assignee | When | Set by |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| `status:available` | none | Issue created or recovered from stale state | issue-sync-helper, or pulse (recovery) |
| `status:queued` | runner user | Pulse dispatches a worker | **Supervisor pulse** |
| `status:in-progress` | worker user | Worker starts coding | **Worker (this step)** |
| `status:in-review` | worker user | PR opened, awaiting review | **Worker (Step 4)** |
| `status:blocked` | unchanged | Task has unresolved blockers | Worker or supervisor (contextual) |
| `status:done` | unchanged | PR merged | sync-on-pr-merge workflow (automated) |
| `status:verify-failed` | unchanged | Post-merge verification failed | Worker (contextual) |
| `status:needs-testing` | unchanged | Code merged, needs manual testing | Worker (contextual) |
| `dispatched:{model}` | unchanged | Worker started on task | **Worker (Step 0.7)** |

**Assignment rules:**
- The pulse assigns the issue to the runner user at dispatch time (before the worker starts). This prevents other runners/humans from picking up the same issue.
- The worker self-assigns in this step as defense-in-depth (covers manual dispatch, interactive sessions).
- If a worker crashes and the issue goes stale (3+ hours with no PR), the pulse recovers it: relabels to `status:available`, unassigns, and comments explaining the recovery.

**Consistency rule:** When setting a new status label, always remove the prior status labels to keep exactly one active.

### Step 0.7: Label Dispatch Model — `dispatched:{model}`

After setting `status:in-progress`, tag the issue with the model running this worker. This provides observability into which model solved each task — essential for cost/quality analysis.

**Detect the current model** from the system prompt or environment. The model name appears in the system prompt as "You are powered by the model named X" or via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_MODEL` environment variables. Map to a short label:

| Model contains | Label |
|----------------|-------|
| `opus` | `dispatched:opus` |
| `sonnet` | `dispatched:sonnet` |
| `haiku` | `dispatched:haiku` |
| unknown | skip labeling |

```bash
# Detect model — check env vars first, fall back to known model identity
MODEL_SHORT=""
for VAR in "$ANTHROPIC_MODEL" "$CLAUDE_MODEL"; do
  case "$VAR" in
    *opus*)   MODEL_SHORT="opus" ;;
    *sonnet*) MODEL_SHORT="sonnet" ;;
    *haiku*)  MODEL_SHORT="haiku" ;;
  esac
  [[ -n "$MODEL_SHORT" ]] && break
done

# Fallback: the agent knows its own model from the system prompt.
# If env vars are empty, set MODEL_SHORT based on your model identity.
# Example: if you are claude-opus-4-6, set MODEL_SHORT="opus"

if [[ -n "$MODEL_SHORT" && -n "$ISSUE_NUM" && "$ISSUE_NUM" != "null" ]]; then
  REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)

  # Remove stale dispatched:* labels so attribution is unambiguous
  for OLD in "dispatched:opus" "dispatched:sonnet" "dispatched:haiku"; do
    if [[ "$OLD" != "dispatched:${MODEL_SHORT}" ]]; then
      if ! gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --remove-label "$OLD" 2>/dev/null; then
        : # Label not present — expected, not an error
      fi
    fi
  done

  # Create the label if it doesn't exist yet
  if ! LABEL_ERR=$(gh label create "dispatched:${MODEL_SHORT}" --repo "$REPO" \
    --description "Task dispatched to ${MODEL_SHORT} model" --color "1D76DB" 2>&1); then
    # "already exists" is expected — only warn on other failures
    if [[ "$LABEL_ERR" != *"already exists"* ]]; then
      echo "[dispatch-label] Warning: label create failed for dispatched:${MODEL_SHORT} on ${REPO}: ${LABEL_ERR}" >&2
    fi
  fi

  if ! EDIT_ERR=$(gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" \
    --add-label "dispatched:${MODEL_SHORT}" 2>&1); then
    echo "[dispatch-label] Warning: could not add dispatched:${MODEL_SHORT} to issue #${ISSUE_NUM} on ${REPO}: ${EDIT_ERR}" >&2
  fi
fi
```

**For interactive sessions** (not headless dispatch): If you are working on a task interactively and the issue exists, apply the label based on your own model identity. This ensures all task work is attributed, not just headless dispatches.

### Step 0.8: Task Decomposition Check (t1408)

Before starting implementation, check if the task should be decomposed into subtasks. This catches over-scoped tasks before they waste a worker session.

```bash
# Check if task already has subtasks (skip if already decomposed)
HAS_SUBS=$(~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/task-decompose-helper.sh has-subtasks "$TASK_ID" || echo "false")

if [[ "$HAS_SUBS" == "false" ]]; then
  # Classify the task
  CLASSIFY=$(~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/task-decompose-helper.sh classify "$TASK_DESC" || echo '{"kind":"atomic"}')
  TASK_KIND=$(echo "$CLASSIFY" | sed -n 's/.*"kind"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')

  if [[ "$TASK_KIND" == "composite" ]]; then
    # Decompose into subtasks
    DECOMPOSITION=$(~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/task-decompose-helper.sh decompose "$TASK_DESC" || echo "")

    # Interactive mode: show tree and ask for confirmation
    # Headless mode: auto-proceed (create child tasks and dispatch)
  fi
fi
```

**Interactive mode:** If the task is composite, show the decomposition tree and ask: "This task has multiple independent concerns. Should I split it into subtasks? [Y/n/edit]". On confirm, create child TODO entries with `claim-task-id.sh`, set `blocked-by:` edges, and dispatch workers for each leaf subtask.

**Headless mode:** Auto-decompose and create child tasks. Depth limit: `DECOMPOSE_MAX_DEPTH` (default: 3). Skip decomposition for tasks that already have subtasks in TODO.md.

**When to skip:** If the task is atomic (most tasks), proceed directly to Step 1. The classify call costs ~$0.001 (haiku-tier) and takes <1 second.

### Step 1: Auto-Branch Setup

The loop automatically handles branch setup when on main/master:

```bash
# Run pre-edit check in loop mode with task description
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/pre-edit-check.sh --loop-mode --task "$ARGUMENTS"
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Already on feature branch OR docs-only task (proceed)
- `1` - Interactive mode fallback (shouldn't happen in loop)
- `2` - Code task on main (auto-create worktree)

**Auto-decision logic:**
- **Docs-only tasks** (README, CHANGELOG, docs/, typos): Stay on main
- **Code tasks** (features, fixes, refactors, enhancements): Auto-create worktree

**Detection keywords:**
- Docs-only: `readme`, `changelog`, `documentation`, `docs/`, `typo`, `spelling`
- Code (overrides docs): `feature`, `fix`, `bug`, `implement`, `refactor`, `add`, `update`, `enhance`, `port`, `ssl`

**When worktree is needed:**

```bash
# Generate branch name from task (sanitized, truncated to 40 chars)
branch_name=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g' | cut -c1-40)

# Preferred: Use Worktrunk (wt) if installed
wt switch -c "feature/$branch_name"

# Fallback: Use worktree-helper.sh if wt not available
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-helper.sh add "feature/$branch_name"
# Continue in new worktree directory
```

Also verify:
- **Clean working directory**: Uncommitted changes should be committed or stashed
- **Git remote configured**: Need to push and create PR

```bash
git status --short
```

### Step 1.5: Operation Verification (t1364.3)

Before executing high-stakes operations (production deploys, database migrations, force pushes, secret rotation), the pipeline invokes cross-provider model verification. This catches single-model hallucinations before destructive operations cause irreversible damage.

**How it works:**

```bash
# The pre-edit-check.sh now accepts --verify-op for operation-level checks
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/pre-edit-check.sh --verify-op "git push --force origin main"

# Or source the helper directly for programmatic use
source ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/verify-operation-helper.sh
risk=$(check_operation "terraform destroy")        # Returns: critical, high, moderate, low
result=$(verify_operation "terraform destroy" "$risk")  # Returns: verified, concerns:*, blocked:*
```

**Risk taxonomy:**

| Level | Examples | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| critical | Force push to main, `rm -rf /`, drop database, deploy to production, expose secrets | Block (headless) or require confirmation (interactive) |
| high | Force push, hard reset, branch deletion, DB migration, npm publish | Verify via cross-provider model call |
| moderate | Package installs, config changes, permission changes | Log only (verify in `block` policy mode) |
| low | Code edits, docs, tests | No verification |

**Pipeline integration points:**

- **pre-edit-check.sh**: Pass `--verify-op "command"` to verify before execution
- **dispatch.sh**: Automatically screens task descriptions for high-stakes indicators before committing a worker
- **full-loop**: Verification runs at branch setup and before destructive git operations

**Configuration** (environment variables):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VERIFY_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable verification globally |
| `VERIFY_POLICY` | `warn` | `warn` (log concerns), `block` (stop on concerns), `skip` (disable) |
| `VERIFY_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Seconds to wait for verifier response |
| `VERIFY_MODEL` | `haiku` | Model tier for verification (cheapest sufficient) |

### Step 1.7: Parse Lineage Context (t1408.3)

If the dispatch prompt contains a `TASK LINEAGE:` block (injected by the pulse or interactive dispatcher for subtasks), parse it at session start. This block tells you your place in a task hierarchy — what the parent task is, what sibling tasks exist, and what your specific scope is.

**Detection:**

```bash
# Check if the dispatch arguments contain lineage context
if echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -q "TASK LINEAGE:"; then
  HAS_LINEAGE=true
fi
```

**Worker rules when lineage is present:**

1. **Scope boundary** — Only implement what's marked with `<-- THIS TASK`. If you find yourself implementing functionality described in a sibling task's description, stop and refocus.

2. **Stub dependencies** — If your task needs types, APIs, or interfaces that a sibling task will create, define minimal stubs (e.g., a TypeScript interface, a function signature with `TODO` body). Document these stubs in the PR body under a "Cross-task stubs" section so the sibling worker knows to replace them.

3. **No sibling work** — Do not implement features described in sibling task descriptions, even if they seem easy or closely related. Each sibling has its own worker, branch, and PR. Overlapping implementations cause merge conflicts.

4. **PR body lineage section** — When creating the PR, include a "Task Lineage" section:

   ```markdown
   ## Task Lineage

   This task is part of a decomposed parent task:
   - **Parent:** t1408 — Recursive task decomposition for dispatch
   - **This task:** t1408.3 — Add lineage context to worker dispatch prompts
   - **Siblings:** t1408.1 (classify/decompose helper), t1408.2 (dispatch integration), t1408.4 (batch strategies), t1408.5 (testing)

   ### Cross-task stubs
   - None (this task is documentation-only)
   ```

5. **Blocked by sibling** — If you discover a hard dependency on a sibling task (not just a stub-able interface, but a fundamental prerequisite like "the database table doesn't exist yet"), exit cleanly:

   ```text
   BLOCKED: This task (t1408.3) requires task-decompose-helper.sh from sibling t1408.1,
   which has not been merged yet. Cannot test lineage formatting without the helper.
   Partial work committed on branch feature/t1408.3-lineage-context.
   ```

### Step 2: Start Full Loop

**Supervisor dispatch** (headless mode - t174):

When dispatched by the supervisor, `--headless` is passed automatically. This suppresses all interactive prompts, prevents TODO.md edits, and ensures clean exit on errors. You can also set `FULL_LOOP_HEADLESS=true` as an environment variable.

**Recommended: Background mode** (avoids timeout issues):

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh start "$ARGUMENTS" --background
```

This starts the loop in the background and returns immediately. Use these commands to monitor:

```bash
# Check status
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh status

# View logs
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh logs

# Cancel if needed
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh cancel
```

**Foreground mode** (may timeout in MCP tools):

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh start "$ARGUMENTS"
```

This will:
1. Initialize the Ralph loop for task development
2. Set up state tracking in `.agents/loop-state/full-loop.local.md`
3. Begin iterating on the task

**Note**: Foreground mode may timeout when called via MCP Bash tool (default 120s timeout). Use `--background` for long-running tasks.

### Step 3: Task Development (Ralph Loop)

The AI will iterate on the task until outputting:

```text
<promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise>
```

**Completion criteria (ALL must be satisfied before emitting TASK_COMPLETE):**

1. All requirements implemented — list each as [DONE], if any are [TODO] keep working
2. Tests passing (if applicable)
3. Code quality acceptable (lint, shellcheck, type-check)
4. **Generalization check** — solution works for varying inputs, not just current state
5. **README gate passed** — required if task adds/changes user-facing features (see below)
6. Conventional commits used — required for all commits (enables auto-changelog)
7. **Headless rules observed** (see below)
8. **Actionable finding coverage** — if this task produces a multi-finding report (audit/review/scan), every deferred actionable finding has a tracked follow-up (`task_id` + issue ref)
9. **Commit+PR gate (GH#5317 — MANDATORY)** — ALL changes committed and a PR exists before emitting `TASK_COMPLETE`. This is the #1 failure mode: workers print "Implementation complete" and exit without committing or creating a PR, leaving files uncommitted in the worktree. Run this check immediately before emitting `TASK_COMPLETE`:

   ```bash
   # Verify no uncommitted changes remain
   UNCOMMITTED=$(git status --porcelain | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
   if [[ "$UNCOMMITTED" -gt 0 ]]; then
     echo "[GH#5317] Uncommitted changes detected — committing before TASK_COMPLETE"
     git add -A
     git commit -m "feat: complete implementation (GH#5317 commit gate)"
   fi

   # Verify a PR exists (create one if not)
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
   if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" && "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "master" ]]; then
     git push -u origin HEAD 2>/dev/null || git push origin HEAD
     if ! gh pr view >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       echo "[GH#5317] No PR found — creating PR before TASK_COMPLETE"
       # PR creation happens in Step 4 — proceed there now, do NOT emit TASK_COMPLETE yet
     fi
   fi
   ```

   **Do NOT emit `TASK_COMPLETE` if there are uncommitted changes or no PR.** Fix the gap first, then emit the signal. `TASK_COMPLETE` means "implementation done AND PR exists" — not just "implementation done".

**Actionable finding coverage procedure (mandatory when output includes multiple findings):**

1. Build an actionable list for deferred items (one line per finding) in a temp file using this format:

   ```text
   severity|title|details
   ```

2. Convert that list into tracked tasks and issues with:

   ```bash
   ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/findings-to-tasks-helper.sh create \
     --input <path/to/actionable-findings.txt> \
     --repo-path "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" \
     --source <audit|review|seo|accessibility|performance>
   ```

3. Include proof in your PR body or final report:
   - `actionable_findings_total=<N>`
   - `fixed_in_pr=<N>`
   - `deferred_tasks_created=<N>`
   - `coverage=100%`

If coverage is below 100%, the task is not complete.

**Parallelism rule (t217)**: When your task involves multiple independent operations (reading several files, running lint + typecheck + tests, researching separate modules), use the Task tool to run them concurrently in a single message — not one at a time. Serial execution of independent work wastes wall-clock time proportional to the number of subtasks. See `tools/ai-assistants/headless-dispatch.md` "Worker Efficiency Protocol" point 5 for criteria and examples.

**Replanning rule**: If your approach isn't working after a reasonable attempt, step back
and try a fundamentally different strategy before giving up. A fresh approach often
succeeds where incremental fixes to a broken one fail.

**CI failure debugging (t1334)**: When a task involves fixing CI failures or a PR has
failing checks, ALWAYS read the CI logs first before attempting any code changes:

```bash
# 1. Identify the failing job
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --repo <owner/repo>

# 2. Get the run ID and read failure logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --repo <owner/repo> --log | grep -iE 'FAIL|Error.*spec|expect.*received'

# 3. Identify the EXACT test name, file, and line number from the error
```

This prevents context exhaustion from blind debugging. Workers that skip this step
waste entire sessions guessing at root causes. Common pitfalls:
- Testing the wrong DOM element (e.g., `<main>` vs its child `<div>`)
- Assuming infrastructure issues (OOM, timeouts) when the test itself is wrong
- Not checking if another PR (e.g., a CI investigation PR) already identified the fix

**Quality-debt blast radius cap (t1422 — MANDATORY for quality-debt tasks):**

When working on a quality-debt, simplification-debt, or batch-fix task (any task whose issue has `quality-debt` or `simplification-debt` labels, or whose description mentions "batch", "across N files", or "harden N scripts"), the PR must touch **at most 5 files**. This is a hard cap — not a guideline.

**Why:** Large batch PRs (10-69 files) conflict with every other PR in flight. When multiple batch PRs exist concurrently, each merge moves main and invalidates the others, creating a cascade where 63%+ of open PRs become `CONFLICTING`. Small PRs merge cleanly in any order.

**How to comply:**

1. If the issue describes fixes across more than 5 files, implement only the first 5 (prioritise by severity). Commit and create the PR for those 5.
2. File follow-up issues for the remaining files — one issue per 5-file batch, or one issue per file for complex fixes.
3. Do NOT attempt to fix all files in a single PR. A partial PR that merges cleanly is worth more than a complete PR that conflicts.

**Detection:** Before creating the PR, count the files you've changed:

```bash
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
if [[ "$CHANGED_FILES" -gt 5 ]]; then
  echo "[t1422] WARNING: $CHANGED_FILES files changed — quality-debt PRs must touch at most 5 files"
  echo "Split into multiple PRs or file follow-up issues for remaining files"
fi
```

If you exceed 5 files, split the work before creating the PR. This rule does NOT apply to feature PRs, bug fixes, or refactors — only to automated quality-debt and batch-fix tasks.

**Headless dispatch rules (MANDATORY for supervisor-dispatched workers - t158/t174):**

When running as a headless worker (dispatched by the supervisor via `opencode run` or `Claude -p`), the `--headless` flag is passed automatically. The full-loop-helper.sh script enforces these rules:

1. **NEVER prompt for user input** - There is no human at the terminal. Use the uncertainty decision framework (rule 7) to decide whether to proceed or exit.

2. **Do NOT edit TODO.md** - Put notes in commit messages or PR body instead. See `workflows/plans.md` "Worker TODO.md Restriction".

3. **Do NOT edit shared planning files** - Files like `todo/PLANS.md`, `todo/tasks/*` are managed by the supervisor. Workers should only modify files relevant to their assigned task.

4. **Handle auth failures gracefully** - If `gh auth status` fails, the script retries 3 times then exits cleanly with a clear error for supervisor evaluation. Do NOT retry indefinitely.

5. **Exit cleanly on unrecoverable errors** - If you cannot complete the task (missing dependencies, permissions, etc.), emit a clear error message and exit. Do not loop forever.

6. **git pull --rebase before push** (t174) - The PR create phase automatically runs `git pull --rebase` to sync with any remote changes before pushing, avoiding push rejections.

7. **Uncertainty decision framework** (t176) - When facing ambiguity, use this decision tree:

   **PROCEED autonomously** (document decision in commit message):
   - Multiple valid approaches exist but all achieve the goal — pick the simplest
   - Style/naming choices are ambiguous — follow existing codebase conventions
   - Task description is slightly vague but intent is clear from context
   - Choosing between equivalent libraries/patterns — match project precedent
   - Minor scope questions (e.g., fix adjacent issue?) — stay focused on assigned task

   **EXIT cleanly** (include clear explanation in output):
   - Task description contradicts what you find in the codebase
   - Completing the task requires breaking changes to public APIs or shared interfaces
   - The task is already done or obsolete
   - Required dependencies, credentials, or services are missing and cannot be inferred
   - The task requires architectural decisions that affect other tasks
   - Unsure whether to create vs modify a file, and getting it wrong risks data loss

   When proceeding, document the choice: `feat: add retry logic (chose exponential backoff — matches existing patterns)`
   When exiting, be specific: `BLOCKED: Task says 'update auth endpoint' but 3 exist (JWT, OAuth, API key). Need clarification.`

8. **Worker time budget and progressive PR (MANDATORY for headless workers):**

   Workers MUST be aware of elapsed time and act progressively to avoid the systemic pattern of running 3-9 hours without producing any PR. The goal is: **always produce a PR, even if partial.**

   **Time checkpoints:**

   - **At 45 minutes:** Self-check — have you made meaningful progress? If you're stuck on a dependency (missing schema, unmerged prerequisite, missing API), do NOT keep trying to work around it. Instead:
     1. Commit what you have (even if incomplete)
     2. Exit cleanly with: `BLOCKED: dependency not available — <specific dependency>. Partial work committed on branch.`
     3. The supervisor will re-dispatch when the dependency merges.

   - **At 90 minutes:** If you have working code (even partial), begin the PR phase immediately:
     1. Commit all work with `feat: partial implementation of <task> (time budget)`
     2. Create a draft PR with `gh pr create --draft` explaining what's done and what remains
     3. File subtask issues for remaining work
     4. Exit cleanly — a partial PR is infinitely more valuable than no PR after 3 hours

   - **At 120 minutes (hard limit):** Stop all implementation work. PR whatever you have:
     1. If you have ANY commits: create a draft PR with a clear "What's done / What remains" section
     2. If you have NO commits (completely stuck): exit with a detailed `BLOCKED:` message explaining exactly what prevented progress
     3. Never exceed 2 hours without either a PR or a clear exit message

   **Dependency detection (early exit):** At the START of task development, before writing any code, verify that the task's prerequisites exist in the codebase:
    - If the task references tables, APIs, or schemas from another task, check if they exist with a context-appropriate search: start broad (`rg 'tableName|functionName'`) and only add file filters that match the repo/task (for example `--glob '*.sql'`, `--glob '*.py'`, `--glob '*.ts'`). Do not assume one language.
   - If the task says "blocked-by: tXXX" in TODO.md or the issue body, check if tXXX's PR is merged: `gh pr list --state merged --search "tXXX"`
   - If prerequisites are missing, exit immediately with `BLOCKED: prerequisite tXXX not merged — <specific missing item>`. Do not attempt to implement the missing prerequisite yourself.

   **Why this matters:** 5 workers running 4+ hours each with no PRs = 20+ hours of wasted compute. A worker that exits after 10 minutes with "BLOCKED: t030 not merged, profile table doesn't exist" saves 3h 50m and gives the supervisor actionable information.

   **Push/PR failure recovery (#2452 pattern):** If `git push` or `gh pr create` fails, do NOT silently continue working. This is the root cause of workers that commit code but never produce a PR — they hit a push failure (auth, branch protection, network) and keep iterating on code instead of addressing the failure. On any push or PR creation failure:
   1. Log the exact error message
   2. Retry once after `git pull --rebase origin main` (handles diverged branches)
   3. If retry fails, exit immediately with: `BLOCKED: push/PR creation failed — <exact error>. Commits exist on local branch <branch-name> in worktree <path>.`
   4. Do NOT continue implementing code after a push failure — the work is unrecoverable without a PR

9. **Cross-repo routing** — If you discover mid-task that the fix belongs in a different repo (e.g., working in a webapp repo but the bug is in an aidevops framework script), do NOT create tasks or TODO entries in the current repo. Instead, file a GitHub issue in the correct repo:

   ```bash
   gh issue create --repo <owner/correct-repo> --title "<description>" \
     --body "Discovered while working on <current-task> in <current-repo>. <details>"
   ```

   **If creating TODOs/PLANS in another repo** (e.g., adding a TODO to `~/Git/aidevops/TODO.md` while working in a webapp repo): always commit and push them immediately so the issue-sync workflow picks them up. Uncommitted TODOs are invisible to the supervisor and issue-sync.

   ```bash
   git -C ~/Git/<target-repo> add TODO.md todo/PLANS.md
   git -C ~/Git/<target-repo> commit -m "chore: add t{id} TODO from <current-repo> session"
   git -C ~/Git/<target-repo> push origin main
   ```

   Then continue with your assigned task in the current repo. The pulse supervisor will pick up the cross-repo issue on its next cycle. This prevents framework-level work from being tracked in app repos and vice versa.

   **Scope boundary for code changes (t1405, GH#2928):** When dispatched by the pulse (headless mode), the `PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS` env var contains a comma-separated list of repo slugs that you are allowed to create branches and PRs on. This is set by `pulse-wrapper.sh` from repos with `pulse: true` in repos.json.

   - **Filing issues**: ALWAYS allowed on any repo, regardless of scope. Cross-repo bug reports are valuable feedback to maintainers.
   - **Creating branches, PRs, or committing code**: ONLY allowed on repos listed in `PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS`. If the target repo is not in scope, file the issue and stop — do NOT implement the fix.
   - **If `PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS` is empty or unset**: you are in interactive mode (not pulse-dispatched) — no scope restriction applies.

   ```bash
   # Check if a target repo is in scope before creating code changes
   TARGET_SLUG="owner/repo"
   if [[ -n "${PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS:-}" ]]; then
     if ! echo ",$PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS," | grep -qF ",$TARGET_SLUG,"; then
       echo "Repo $TARGET_SLUG is outside pulse scope — filing issue only, not implementing fix"
       gh issue create --repo "$TARGET_SLUG" --title "TITLE" \
         --body "Discovered while working on CURRENT_TASK. DETAILS"
       echo "BLOCKED: target repo out of pulse scope; issue filed — stopping."
       exit 0
     fi
   fi
   ```

   This prevents the pattern where a pulse-dispatched worker creates PRs on repos the user doesn't manage (observed: 4 PRs + a fork on a repo the user doesn't own).

10. **Issue-task alignment (MANDATORY)** — Before linking your PR to an issue or claiming a task, verify your work matches the issue's actual description. Workers have hijacked issues by using a task ID for completely unrelated work (e.g., PR "Fix ShellCheck noise" closed issue "Add local dev row to build-plus.md" because both used t1344).

    **Before creating a PR that references an issue:**
    - Read the issue title and body: `gh issue view <number> --repo <owner/repo>`
    - Verify your PR's changes actually implement what the issue describes
    - If your work is unrelated to the issue, create a new issue for your work instead

    **If you discover your assigned task is already done or the issue was closed:**
    - Check if the closing PR actually implemented the task (read the PR diff)
    - If the PR was unrelated work that incorrectly closed the issue, reopen it and comment explaining the mismatch
    - Do NOT silently reuse a task ID for different work

**README gate (MANDATORY - do NOT skip):**

Before emitting `TASK_COMPLETE`, answer this decision tree:

1. Did this task add a new feature, tool, API, command, or config option? → **Update README.md**
2. Did this task change existing user-facing behavior? → **Update README.md**
3. Is this a pure refactor, bugfix with no behavior change, or internal-only change? → **SKIP**

If README update is needed:

```bash
# For any repo: use targeted section updates
/readme --sections "usage"  # or relevant section

# For aidevops repo: also check if counts are stale
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/readme-helper.sh check
# If stale, run: readme-helper.sh update --apply
```

**Do NOT emit TASK_COMPLETE until README is current.** This is a gate, not a suggestion. The t099 Neural-Chromium task was merged without a README update because this gate was advisory - it is now mandatory.

### Step 4: Automatic Phase Progression

After `TASK_COMPLETE` (which requires the commit+PR gate from Step 3 criterion 9 to have already passed), the loop continues through the post-PR lifecycle:

1. **Preflight**: Runs quality checks, auto-fixes issues
2. **PR Create**: Verifies `gh auth`, rebases onto `origin/main`, pushes branch, creates PR with proper title/body. **Note:** If the commit+PR gate in Step 3 already created the PR, this step confirms it exists and ensures the PR body has proper issue linkage — it does not create a duplicate.
   **Issue linkage in PR body (MANDATORY):** The PR body MUST include `Closes #NNN` (or `Fixes`/`Resolves`) for every related issue — this is the ONLY mechanism that creates a GitHub PR-issue link.

   **Primary source: use `$ISSUE_NUM` from Step 0.** The issue number resolved during dispatch (from arguments, TODO.md `ref:GH#`, or `gh issue list` by task ID) is the authoritative source. Always include `Closes #$ISSUE_NUM` in the PR body. Do NOT re-search by keywords — keyword search across issues with similar titles (e.g., multiple subtasks of the same parent) returns wrong matches.

   **Secondary: search for additional related issues only.** After including the primary `$ISSUE_NUM`, optionally search for duplicate or related issues (e.g., CodeRabbit-created issues for the same task): `gh issue list --state open --search "<task_id>:"`. Only add `Closes` for issues whose title starts with the same task ID prefix. Never add `Closes` for an issue you found by keyword similarity alone — verify the task ID matches.

   A comment like "Resolved by PR #NNN" does NOT create a link — only closing keywords in the PR body do. **Caution:** GitHub parses `Closes #NNN` anywhere in the PR body — including explanatory prose. If describing a bug that involved wrong issue linkage, use backtick-escaped references (`` `Closes #NNN` ``) or rephrase to avoid the pattern. PR #2512 itself closed the wrong issue because its description mentioned `Closes #2498` when explaining the original bug.
3. **Label Update**: Update linked issue to `status:in-review` (see below)
4. **PR Review**: Monitors CI checks and review status
5. **Review Bot Gate (t1382)**: Wait for AI review bots before merge (see below)
6. **Merge**: Squash merge (without `--delete-branch` when in worktree)
7. **Auto-Release**: Bump patch version + create GitHub release (aidevops repo only — see below)
8. **Issue Closing Comment**: Post a summary comment on linked issues, including release version (see below)
9. **Worktree Cleanup**: Return to main repo, pull, clean merged worktrees
10. **Postflight**: Verifies release health after merge
11. **Deploy**: Runs `setup.sh --non-interactive` (aidevops repos only)

**Issue-state guard before any label/comment modification (t1343 — MANDATORY):**

Before modifying any linked issue (adding labels, posting comments, or changing state), ALWAYS check its current state. Use fail-closed semantics — only proceed when state is explicitly `OPEN`:

```bash
for ISSUE_NUM in $LINKED_ISSUES; do
  ISSUE_STATE=$(gh issue view "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --json state -q .state 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
  if [[ "$ISSUE_STATE" != "OPEN" ]]; then
    # Fail closed: skip on CLOSED, UNKNOWN, empty, or any non-OPEN state.
    # CLOSED = already resolved by another session. UNKNOWN = gh failure/timeout.
    # Either way, do NOT modify — modifications on ambiguous state cause noise.
    echo "[t1343] Skipping issue #$ISSUE_NUM — state is $ISSUE_STATE (not OPEN)"
    continue
  fi
  # ... proceed with label/comment updates only for OPEN issues
done
```

This prevents the race condition where a worker's delayed lifecycle transition overwrites a supervisor's correct closure. If the issue is already closed with a merged PR, any further label changes (`needs-review`, `status:in-review`, etc.) are noise. The fail-closed design also protects against transient `gh` failures — if the state check fails, modifications are skipped rather than allowed.

**PR lookup fallback (t1343):** When checking whether a merged PR exists for the current task (e.g., before deciding to flag an issue as `needs-review`), do NOT rely solely on your session's local state. Use the fallback chain from `planning-detail.md` "PR Lookup Fallback" — check local state first, then `gh pr list --state merged --search "<task_id>"`, then issue timeline cross-references. If ANY source confirms a merged PR, the task has PR evidence.

**Issue label update on PR create — `status:in-review`:**

After creating the PR, update linked issues to `status:in-review`. Extract linked issue numbers from the PR body (`Fixes #NNN`, `Closes #NNN`, `Resolves #NNN`) and update each:

```bash
for ISSUE_NUM in $LINKED_ISSUES; do
  # t1343: Check issue state before modifying — fail closed (only modify if explicitly OPEN)
  ISSUE_STATE=$(gh issue view "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --json state -q .state 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
  if [[ "$ISSUE_STATE" != "OPEN" ]]; then
    echo "[t1343] Skipping issue #$ISSUE_NUM — state is $ISSUE_STATE (not OPEN)"
    continue
  fi
  gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --add-label "status:in-review" 2>/dev/null || true
  gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --remove-label "status:in-progress" 2>/dev/null || true
done
```

The `status:done` transition is handled automatically by the `sync-on-pr-merge` workflow when the PR merges — workers do not need to set it.

**Review Bot Gate (t1382 — MANDATORY before merge):**

Before merging any PR, wait for AI code review bots to post their reviews. This is a defense-in-depth gate with three layers:

1. **CI layer**: The `review-bot-gate` GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/review-bot-gate.yml`) runs as a required status check. It checks for comments/reviews from known bots (CodeRabbit, Gemini Code Assist, Augment Code, Copilot) and fails until at least one has posted. The workflow re-triggers on `pull_request_review` and `issue_comment` events, so it automatically passes once a bot reviews.

2. **Agent layer (this rule)**: After creating the PR and before merging, the agent MUST verify that at least one AI review bot has posted. Use the helper script:

   ```bash
   REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
   RESULT=$(~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/review-bot-gate-helper.sh check "$PR_NUMBER" "$REPO")
   # Returns: PASS (bots found), WAITING (no bots yet), SKIP (label present)
   ```

   **If WAITING**: Poll every 60 seconds for up to 10 minutes (configurable via `REVIEW_BOT_WAIT_MAX=600`). Most bots post within 2-5 minutes. If still waiting after the timeout:
   - In **interactive mode**: warn the user and ask whether to proceed or wait longer
   - In **headless mode**: proceed with merge but log a warning — the CI gate will block if configured as a required check

   **If PASS**: Proceed to merge. Read the bot reviews and address any critical/security findings before merging. Non-critical suggestions can be noted for follow-up.

   **If SKIP**: The PR has the `skip-review-gate` label — proceed to merge. Use this for docs-only PRs or repos without review bots.

3. **Branch protection layer**: For repos with review bots configured, add `review-bot-gate` as a required status check in GitHub Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules. This is the hard enforcement — even if the agent skips the wait, GitHub blocks the merge.

**Why this matters**: PR #1 on aidevops-cloudron-app was merged before review bots posted, losing all security findings. The bots found real issues that would have been caught if the merge had waited 3 minutes.

**Known review bots** (from `workflows/pr.md`):

| Bot | Login pattern | Typical review time |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| CodeRabbit | `coderabbitai` | 1-3 minutes |
| Gemini Code Assist | `gemini-code-assist[bot]` | 2-5 minutes |
| Augment Code | `augment-code[bot]` | 2-4 minutes |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot[bot]` | 1-3 minutes |

**Auto-release after merge (aidevops repo only — MANDATORY):**

After merging a PR on the aidevops repo (`marcusquinn/aidevops`), cut a patch release so contributors and auto-update users receive the fix immediately. Without this step, fixes sit on main indefinitely until someone manually releases.

```bash
# Only for the aidevops repo — skip for all other repos
REPO_SLUG=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [[ "$REPO_SLUG" == "marcusquinn/aidevops" ]]; then
  # Pull the merge commit to the canonical repo directory
  REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
  CANONICAL_DIR="${REPO_ROOT%%.*}"  # Strip worktree suffix if present
  git -C "$CANONICAL_DIR" pull origin main

  # Bump patch version (updates VERSION, package.json, setup.sh, etc.)
  (cd "$CANONICAL_DIR" && "$HOME/.aidevops/agents/scripts/version-manager.sh" bump patch)
  NEW_VERSION=$(cat "$CANONICAL_DIR/VERSION")

  # Commit, tag, push, create release
  git -C "$CANONICAL_DIR" add -A
  git -C "$CANONICAL_DIR" commit -m "chore(release): bump version to v${NEW_VERSION}"
  git -C "$CANONICAL_DIR" push origin main
  git -C "$CANONICAL_DIR" tag "v${NEW_VERSION}"
  git -C "$CANONICAL_DIR" push origin "v${NEW_VERSION}"

  # Create GitHub release with auto-generated notes
  gh release create "v${NEW_VERSION}" --repo "$REPO_SLUG" \
    --title "v${NEW_VERSION} - AI DevOps Framework" \
    --generate-notes

  # Deploy locally
  "$CANONICAL_DIR/setup.sh" --non-interactive || true
fi
```

**Why patch (not minor/major)?** Workers cannot determine release significance — that requires human judgment about breaking changes and feature scope. Patch is always safe. The maintainer can manually cut a minor/major release when appropriate.

**Headless mode:** Auto-release runs in headless mode too. The version bump is atomic (single commit + tag), and `--generate-notes` avoids the need to compose release notes.

**Issue closing comment (MANDATORY — do NOT skip):**

After the PR merges, post a closing comment on every linked GitHub issue. This preserves the context that would otherwise die with the worker session. The comment is the permanent record of what was done.

Find linked issues from the PR body (`Fixes #NNN`, `Closes #NNN`, `Resolves #NNN`):

```bash
# Get the PR body and extract linked issue numbers
PR_BODY=$(gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <owner/repo> --json body -q .body)
# Parse "Fixes #123", "Closes #456", "Resolves #789" patterns
```

For each linked issue, post a comment with this structure:

```bash
gh issue comment <ISSUE_NUMBER> --repo <owner/repo> --body "$(cat <<'COMMENT'
## Completed via PR #<PR_NUMBER>

**What was done:**
- <bullet list of what was implemented/fixed>

**How it was tested:**
- <what tests were run, what was verified>

**Key decisions:**
- <any non-obvious choices made and why>

**Files changed:**
- `path/to/file.ext` — <what changed and why>

**Blockers encountered:**
- <any issues hit during implementation, and how they were resolved>
- None (if clean)

**Follow-up needs:**
- <anything that should be done next but was out of scope>
- None (if complete)

**Released in:** v<VERSION> — run `aidevops update` to get this fix.
COMMENT
)"
```

**Rules:**
- Every section must have at least one bullet (use "None" if nothing to report)
- Be specific — "fixed the bug" is useless; "fixed race condition in worktree creation by adding `sleep 2` between dispatches" is useful
- Include file paths with brief descriptions so future workers can find the changes
- If the task was dispatched by the supervisor, include the original dispatch description for traceability
- **Include the release version** in the "Released in" line if an auto-release was cut (aidevops repo). Read the version from `VERSION` after the release step. For non-aidevops repos, omit the "Released in" line.
- This is a gate: do NOT emit `FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE` until closing comments are posted

**Worktree cleanup after merge:**

See [`worktree-cleanup.md`](worktree-cleanup.md) for the full cleanup sequence (merge without `--delete-branch`, pull main, prune worktrees). Key constraint: never pass `--delete-branch` to `gh pr merge` when running from inside a worktree.

### Step 5: Human Decision Points

> **Note**: In `--headless` mode (t174), the loop never pauses for human input. It proceeds autonomously through all phases and exits cleanly if blocked.

The loop pauses for human input at (interactive mode only):

| Point | When | Action Required |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Merge approval | If repo requires human approval | Approve PR in GitHub |
| Rollback | If postflight detects issues | Decide whether to rollback |
| Scope change | If task evolves beyond original | Confirm new scope |

### Step 6: Completion

When all phases complete:

```text
<promise>FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE</promise>
```

## Commands

```bash
# Start new loop
/full-loop "Implement feature X with tests"

# Check status
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh status

# Resume after interruption
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh resume

# Cancel loop
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh cancel
```

## Options

Pass options after the prompt:

```bash
/full-loop "Fix bug Y" --max-task-iterations 30 --skip-postflight
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--background`, `--bg` | Run in background (recommended for long tasks) |
| `--headless` | Fully headless worker mode (no prompts, no TODO.md edits) |
| `--max-task-iterations N` | Max iterations for task (default: 50) |
| `--max-preflight-iterations N` | Max iterations for preflight (default: 5) |
| `--max-pr-iterations N` | Max iterations for PR review (default: 20) |
| `--skip-preflight` | Skip preflight checks |
| `--skip-postflight` | Skip postflight monitoring |
| `--no-auto-pr` | Pause for manual PR creation |
| `--no-auto-deploy` | Don't auto-run setup.sh |

## Examples

```bash
# Basic feature implementation (background mode recommended)
/full-loop "Add user authentication with JWT tokens" --background

# Foreground mode (may timeout for long tasks)
/full-loop "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Bug fix with limited iterations
/full-loop "Fix memory leak in connection pool" --max-task-iterations 20 --background

# Skip postflight for quick iteration
/full-loop "Update documentation" --skip-postflight

# Manual PR creation
/full-loop "Refactor database layer" --no-auto-pr --background

# View background loop progress
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh logs
```

## Documentation & Changelog

### README Updates

README updates are enforced by the **README gate** in Step 3 completion criteria. You do NOT need to include "and update README" in your prompt - the gate catches it automatically.

When the gate triggers, update README.md with:
- New feature documentation

### Changelog (Auto-Generated)

The release workflow auto-generates CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits. Use proper commit prefixes during task development:

| Prefix | Changelog Section | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| `feat:` | Added | `feat: add JWT authentication` |
| `fix:` | Fixed | `fix: resolve token expiration bug` |
| `docs:` | Changed | `docs: update API documentation` |
| `perf:` | Changed | `perf: optimize database queries` |
| `refactor:` | Changed | `refactor: simplify auth middleware` |
| `chore:` | (excluded) | `chore: update dependencies` |

See `workflows/changelog.md` for format details.

## OpenProse Orchestration

For complex multi-phase workflows, consider expressing the full loop in OpenProse DSL:

```prose
agent developer:
  model: opus
  prompt: "You are a senior developer"

# Phase 1: Task Development
loop until **task is complete** (max: 50):
  session: developer
    prompt: "Implement the feature, run tests, fix issues"

# Phase 2: Preflight (parallel quality checks)
parallel:
  lint = session "Run linters and fix issues"
  types = session "Check types and fix issues"
  tests = session "Run tests and fix failures"

if **any checks failed**:
  loop until **all checks pass** (max: 5):
    session "Fix remaining issues"
      context: { lint, types, tests }

# Phase 3: PR Creation
let pr = session "Create pull request with gh pr create --fill"

# Phase 4: PR Review Loop
loop until **PR is merged** (max: 20):
  parallel:
    ci = session "Check CI status"
    review = session "Check review status"

  if **CI failed**:
    session "Fix CI issues and push"

  if **changes requested**:
    session "Evaluate review feedback: verify factual claims against runtime/docs/project conventions, dismiss incorrect suggestions with evidence, address valid ones, then push"

# Phase 5: Postflight
session "Verify release health"
```
