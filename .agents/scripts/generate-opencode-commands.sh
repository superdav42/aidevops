Check code audit tool feedback on the latest push.

Target: $ARGUMENTS

**Auto-detection:**
1. If on a feature branch with open PR → check that PR's feedback
2. If on a feature branch without PR → check branch CI status
3. If on main → check latest commit's CI/audit status
4. If no git context or ambiguous → ask user which branch/PR to check

**Checks performed:**
1. GitHub Actions workflow status (pass/fail/pending)
2. CodeRabbit comments and suggestions
3. Codacy analysis results
4. SonarCloud quality gate status
5. Any blocking issues that need resolution

**Commands used:**
- `gh pr view --json reviews,comments` (if PR exists)
- `gh run list --branch=<branch>` (CI status)
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs` (detailed checks)

**Steps:**
1. Run `git log v$(cat VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0")..HEAD --oneline` to see commits since last release
2. If no release type provided, determine it from commits:
   - Any `feat:` or new feature → minor
   - Only `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `refactor:` → patch
   - Any `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `!` → major
3. Run the single release command:
   ```bash
   .agents/scripts/version-manager.sh release [type] --skip-preflight --force
   ```
4. Report the result with the GitHub release URL

**CRITICAL**: Use only the single command above - it handles everything atomically.

Analyze the current conversation and save appropriately based on complexity.

Topic/context: $ARGUMENTS

## Auto-Detection

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Single action, < 2h | TODO.md only |
| User says "quick/simple" | TODO.md only |
| Multiple steps, > 2h | PLANS.md + TODO.md |
| Research/design needed | PLANS.md + TODO.md |

## Workflow

1. Extract from conversation: title, description, estimate, tags, context
2. Classify as Simple or Complex
3. Save with confirmation (numbered options for override)

**Simple (TODO.md):**
```
Saving to TODO.md: "{title}" ~{estimate}
1. Confirm
2. Add more details
3. Create full plan instead
```

**Complex (PLANS.md + TODO.md):**
```
Creating execution plan: "{title}" ~{estimate}
1. Confirm and create
2. Simplify to TODO.md only
3. Add more context first
```

After save, respond:
```
Saved: "{title}" to {location} (~{estimate})
Start anytime with: "Let's work on {title}"
```

## Context Preservation

Capture from conversation:
- Decisions and rationale
- Research findings
- Constraints identified
- Open questions
- Related links

Run the aidevops setup script to deploy the latest changes.

**Command:**
```bash
cd ~/Git/aidevops && ./setup.sh || exit
```

**What this does:**
1. Deploys agents to ~/.aidevops/agents/
2. Updates OpenCode commands in ~/.config/opencode/command/

description: Start iterative AI development loop (Ralph Wiggum technique)
agent: Build+
---

Read ~/.aidevops/agents/workflows/ralph-loop.md and follow its instructions.

Start a Ralph loop for iterative development.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Session Title**: Only set a session title if one hasn't been set already (e.g., by `/ralph-task` which sets `"t042: description"`). If no task-prefixed title exists, use `session-rename` with a concise version of the prompt (truncate to ~60 chars if needed).

**Usage:**
```bash
/ralph-loop "<prompt>" --max-iterations <n> --completion-promise "<text>"
```

**Options:**
- `--max-iterations <n>` - Stop after N iterations (default: unlimited)
- `--completion-promise <text>` - Phrase that signals completion

For end-to-end development, prefer `/full-loop` which handles the complete lifecycle.

**How it works:**
1. You work on the task
2. When you try to exit, the SAME prompt is fed back
3. You see your previous work in files and git history
4. Iterate until completion or max iterations

**Completion:**
To signal completion, output: `<promise>YOUR_PHRASE</promise>`
The promise must be TRUE - do not output false promises to escape.

**Examples:**
```bash
/ralph-loop "Build a REST API for todos" --max-iterations 20 --completion-promise "DONE"
/ralph-loop "Fix all TypeScript errors" --completion-promise "ALL_FIXED" --max-iterations 10
```

- Current iteration number
- Max iterations setting

Run preflight checks iteratively until all pass or max iterations reached.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage:**
```bash
/preflight-loop [--auto-fix] [--max-iterations N]
```

**Options:**
- `--auto-fix` - Attempt to automatically fix issues
- `--max-iterations N` - Max iterations (default: 10)

**Run the checks:**

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/linters-local.sh
```

**Completion promise:** `<promise>PREFLIGHT_PASS</promise>`

This applies the Ralph Wiggum technique to quality checks:
1. Run all preflight checks (linters-local.sh, shellcheck, markdown lint)
2. If failures and --auto-fix: attempt fixes
3. Re-run checks
4. Repeat until all pass or max iterations

**Examples:**
```bash
/preflight-loop --auto-fix --max-iterations 5
/preflight-loop  # Manual fixes between iterations

/pr-loop [--pr NUMBER] [--wait-for-ci] [--max-iterations N]
```

**Options:**
- `--pr NUMBER` - PR number (auto-detected if not provided)
- `--wait-for-ci` - Wait for CI checks to complete
- `--max-iterations N` - Max iterations (default: 10)

Read ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/commands/pr-loop.md and follow its instructions.

**Completion promises:**
- `<promise>PR_APPROVED</promise>` - PR approved and ready to merge
- `<promise>PR_MERGED</promise>` - PR has been merged

**Workflow:**
1. Check PR status (CI, reviews, mergeable)
2. If changes requested: get feedback, apply fixes, push
3. If CI failed: get annotations, fix issues, push
4. If pending: wait and re-check
5. Repeat until approved/merged or max iterations

**Examples:**
```bash
/pr-loop --wait-for-ci
/pr-loop --pr 123 --max-iterations 20

cat >"$OPENCODE_COMMAND_DIR/ralph-task.md" <<'EOF'
---
description: Run Ralph loop for a task from TODO.md by ID
agent: Build+
---

Run a Ralph loop for a specific task from TODO.md.

Task ID: $ARGUMENTS

**Workflow:**
1. Find task in TODO.md by ID (e.g., t042)
2. Extract ralph metadata (promise, verify command, max iterations)
3. **Set session title** using `session-rename` tool with format: `"t042: Task description here"`
4. Start Ralph loop with extracted parameters

**Task format in TODO.md:**
```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix all ShellCheck violations #ralph ~2h
  ralph-promise: "SHELLCHECK_CLEAN"
  ralph-verify: "shellcheck .agents/scripts/*.sh"

```

**Or shorthand:**
```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix all ShellCheck violations #ralph(SHELLCHECK_CLEAN) ~2h
```

**Usage:**
```bash
/ralph-task t042
```

This will:
1. Read TODO.md and find task t042
2. Extract the ralph-promise, ralph-verify, ralph-max values
3. Set session title to `"t042: {task description}"` using `session-rename` tool
