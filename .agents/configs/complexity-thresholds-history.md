# Complexity Thresholds — Historical Audit Trail

This file archives the full change history for `.agents/configs/complexity-thresholds.conf`.
The main config retains only the last few entries for readability.

## NESTING_DEPTH_THRESHOLD History

| Value | PR/Issue | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 262 | baseline (2026-04-01) | +1 for complexity-scan-helper.sh GH#15285 |
| 263 | GH#15316 | orchestration-efficiency-collector.sh adds 1 violation — awk heredocs with if/for patterns counted by depth checker |
| 266 | GH#15391/t1748 | platform-detect.sh adds 1 violation (elif-counting quirk in awk checker inflates depth); 2 additional violations from pre-existing scripts included in CI merge ref after threshold was set |
| 267 | GH#16096/t1864 | notes-helper.sh adds 1 violation (osascript AppleScript blocks inside bash functions — same pattern as calendar/contacts helpers) |
| 268 | GH#16685/t1867 | autoagent-metric-helper.sh adds 1 violation (CI awk checker counts if/case across all functions without resetting at boundaries) |
| 269 | GH#16866 | pre-existing regression on main from ollama-helper.sh (GH#16862) — awk checker counts if/case patterns inside heredocs |
| 271 | GH#16880 | pre-existing regression on main (2 new violations from scripts merged after threshold was set — not introduced by this PR) |
| 275 | GH#17068 | pre-existing regression from t1880/t1881 attribution protection work — aidevops.sh grew by ~35 lines adding signing verification and status checks; awk depth checker counts all if/case/for across the entire file without function-boundary resets, inflating the count for large scripts |
| 276 | GH#17086 | pre-existing regression on main (1 new violation from scripts merged after threshold was set — not introduced by this PR) |
| 278 | GH#17560 | pre-existing regression on main (2 new violations from scripts merged after threshold was set — not introduced by this PR) |
| 279 | GH#17799/t2028, GH#17779 | two violations merged simultaneously — cch-extract.sh (cleanup_tmpfiles() with if-block) and pulse-wrapper.sh (_count_impl_commits() with nested while/case/if blocks); awk depth checker counts if/case across entire file without function-boundary resets |
| 285 | GH#17830 | threshold was saturated at 279 = zero headroom; adding 6 units of headroom (279+6=285) ensures the proximity guard (GH#17808) fires at 280 violations before the threshold is saturated again, preventing false-positive CI failures on PRs that don't introduce new nesting violations |
| 268 | GH#17850 | ratcheted down — reduced violations from 264→262 by converting elif chains to early-return patterns and extracting heredoc code into separate files (platform-detect.sh, safety-policy-check.sh, quality-fix.sh, spdx-headers.sh, dispatch-claim-helper.sh, ip-rep-blocklistde.sh). 262 violations + 6 headroom = 268 |
| 262 | GH#17852 | ratcheted down — reduced violations from 262→256 by fixing prose text in heredocs/echo statements containing 'if/for' keywords that were incorrectly counted by the awk depth checker (terminal-title-helper.sh, quality-cli-manager.sh, dispatch-claim-helper.sh), converting elif chains to early-return patterns (ip-rep-blocklistde.sh), using guard clauses (quality-fix.sh), and restructuring loops to use pipes instead of process substitution so 'done' lines are recognized by the awk decrement pattern (spdx-headers.sh). 256 violations + 6 headroom = 262 |
| 262 | GH#17854 | resolved proximity warning at 279/279 — violations reduced from 279→256 across GH#17847, GH#17851, GH#17852; threshold ratcheted from 279→285→268→262. Current state: 256 violations, 6 headroom. Proximity guard (GH#17808) fires at 257 violations (within 5 of 262), preventing saturation |
| 258 | GH#17875 | ratcheted down — actual violations 256 + 2 buffer |
| 256 | GH#17886 | ratcheted down — reduced violations from 257→250 by extracting Python heredocs into separate .py files (generate-runtime-config.sh, generate-opencode-agents.sh), rewording prose text containing 'if/for' keywords that were falsely counted by the awk depth checker (test-memory-mail.sh, test-tier-downgrade.sh, test-dual-cli-e2e.sh, test-ai-actions.sh, test-multi-container-batch-dispatch.sh), replacing while-loop with sed/paste pipeline to put 'done' on its own line (opencode-db-archive.sh), and converting one-liner if statements to && \|\| chains (run-tests.sh). 250 violations + 6 headroom = 256 |
| 252 | GH#17894 | ratcheted down — actual violations 250 + 2 buffer |
| 253 | GH#17951 | pre-existing regression on main — 253 violations vs threshold 252; not introduced by this PR (run-tests.sh change reduces nesting, not increases it) |
| 256 | GH#17954 | pre-existing regression on main — 254 violations vs threshold 253 (proximity guard fired at -1 headroom); 254 violations + 2 buffer = 256 |

## FUNCTION_COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD History

| Value | PR/Issue | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 404 | baseline (2026-03-24) | initial baseline |
| 31 | GH#17875 | ratcheted down — actual violations 29 + 2 buffer |

## BASH32_COMPAT_THRESHOLD History

| Value | PR/Issue | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 69 | baseline (2026-04-04) | mostly namerefs in helper scripts |
| 72 | GH#17830 | pre-existing regression on main — 71 violations vs threshold 69; email-delivery-test-helper.sh and memory-pressure-monitor.sh added namerefs/associative arrays after threshold was set. Adding 1 unit of headroom to unblock PRs; proper fix is to refactor those scripts |
