# Browser QA for Milestone Validation

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Visual and functional QA for mission milestones with UI components
- **CLI**: `browser-qa-helper.sh run|screenshot|links|a11y|smoke --url URL --pages "/ /about"`
- **Invoked by**: `workflows/milestone-validation.md` (Phase 3) during mission orchestration
- **Tool stack**: Playwright (primary, fastest) > Stagehand (fallback, self-healing) > DevTools (companion)
- **Output**: JSON/markdown reports with screenshots, broken links, accessibility issues, console errors

**When to use this subagent**: A milestone has UI components and its validation criteria mention pages, visual layout, responsive design, user flows, or frontend rendering. The milestone validation worker reads this doc when it detects a UI milestone.

**Key files**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/browser-qa-helper.sh` | CLI for all browser QA operations |
| `scripts/accessibility/playwright-contrast.mjs` | WCAG contrast ratio checking |
| `tools/browser/browser-automation.md` | Tool selection guide (when to use what) |
| `tools/browser/playwright.md` | Playwright API reference |
| `workflows/milestone-validation.md` | Parent workflow that invokes browser QA |

## How to Think

You are a QA tester with a browser. Your job is to verify that what the user sees matches what the acceptance criteria describe. You are not debugging code — you are testing the rendered output.

**Acceptance criteria drive everything.** Read the milestone's `Validation:` field. Each criterion becomes a specific check. "Homepage renders correctly" becomes: navigate to `/`, verify no console errors, verify content is present, screenshot at desktop and mobile viewports.

**Prefer lightweight checks.** ARIA snapshots (~50-200 tokens) tell you more about page structure than screenshots (~1K vision tokens). Use screenshots for visual regression and layout verification. Use ARIA for functional checks (forms, navigation, interactive elements).

**Report with evidence.** Every failure includes: what was expected, what was found, and a screenshot or ARIA snapshot proving it. The orchestrator uses this evidence to create targeted fix tasks.

## QA Pipeline

### Step 1: Start the Application

Before any browser checks, the app must be running. The milestone validation worker handles this (see `workflows/milestone-validation.md` "Dev Server Management"). If you're invoked directly:

```bash
# Detect and start dev server
if [[ -f "package.json" ]] && jq -e '.scripts.dev' package.json &>/dev/null; then
  npm run dev &
  DEV_PID=$!
fi

# Wait for server
browser-qa-helper.sh smoke --url http://localhost:3000 --pages "/"
```

### Step 2: Smoke Test (Always First)

Verify pages load without errors before doing detailed checks:

```bash
browser-qa-helper.sh smoke --url http://localhost:3000 --pages "/ /about /dashboard /login"
```

**What it checks**:
- HTTP status codes (2xx = pass)
- Console errors (any = flag)
- Failed network requests (any = flag)
- Basic content rendering (body has text)
- Page title exists

**Interpretation**:
- Console errors on page load = likely a bug (React hydration failure, missing API, etc.)
- Network errors = missing assets, broken API calls, CORS issues
- Empty body = rendering crash, blank page bug

### Step 3: Screenshot Capture

Capture visual state at multiple viewports for comparison against acceptance criteria:

```bash
# Desktop + mobile (default)
browser-qa-helper.sh screenshot --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --pages "/ /about /dashboard" \
  --viewports desktop,mobile

# All viewports including tablet
browser-qa-helper.sh screenshot --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --pages "/ /about /dashboard" \
  --viewports desktop,tablet,mobile \
  --full-page \
  --max-dim 4000
```

**Vision-size guardrails**:
- `browser-qa-helper.sh screenshot` now enforces a post-capture image-size guardrail
- Default resize target is `4000px` max dimension (`--max-dim` to override)
- Anthropic hard limit is `8000px` per dimension; values above this are rejected
- The helper uses `sips` (macOS) or `magick` (ImageMagick) to inspect/resize screenshots
- If guardrail checks fail, the command exits non-zero instead of passing oversized images downstream

**Viewport definitions**:

| Name | Width | Height | Use case |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| desktop | 1440 | 900 | Standard desktop |
| tablet | 768 | 1024 | iPad portrait |
| mobile | 375 | 667 | iPhone SE/8 |

**Image size warning**: Full-page screenshots of long pages can exceed Anthropic's hard reject threshold of `8000px` on any single dimension. The `1568px` value refers to an auto-resize trigger on the long edge -- images exceeding this are automatically downscaled by the API, incurring latency penalties. For optimal performance, resize screenshots to ≤1568px on the longest side before sending to a vision API:

```bash
# Resize to max 1568px on longest side (macOS built-in, non-destructive)
sips --resampleHeightWidthMax 1568 screenshot.png --out screenshot-resized.png
# Cross-platform (ImageMagick)
magick screenshot.png -resize "1568x1568>" screenshot-resized.png
```

See `tools/vision/image-understanding.md` for per-provider limits.

**`browser-qa-helper.sh` is the ONLY screenshot path with automatic size guardrails** (GH#4213). All other screenshot paths -- Playwright MCP (`browser_screenshot`), Playwriter MCP (`execute` with `page.screenshot()`), dev-browser scripts, raw Playwright code, and the `ui-verification.md` workflow -- have zero automatic size protection. When taking screenshots through any path other than `browser-qa-helper.sh`, you must either: (1) use viewport-sized screenshots (`fullPage: false` or omit the option), or (2) manually resize full-page captures before including them in conversation context.

**What to look for in screenshots**:
- Layout breaks (overlapping elements, content overflow)
- Missing images or icons (broken `<img>` tags)
- Text truncation or overflow
- Navigation menu rendering (especially mobile hamburger)
- Footer positioning (should be at bottom)
- Form layout and alignment

### Step 4: Broken Link Detection

Crawl internal links and verify they all resolve:

```bash
browser-qa-helper.sh links --url http://localhost:3000 --depth 2
```

**What it checks**:
- All `<a href>` links on each page
- HTTP status of each link (2xx/3xx = ok, 4xx/5xx = broken)
- Only internal links (same origin) are crawled
- Configurable depth (default 2 levels)

**Common findings**:
- 404s from renamed/deleted pages
- Links to API endpoints that return errors without auth

> **Note**: The crawler only follows absolute internal `http*` URLs. Placeholder links (`#`, `javascript:void(0)`) are not detected — use a regex-based scan or manual review for those.

### Step 5: Accessibility Checks

Verify WCAG compliance and structural accessibility:

```bash
browser-qa-helper.sh a11y --url http://localhost:3000 --pages "/ /about" --level AA
```

**What it checks**:
- **Contrast ratios** (via `playwright-contrast.mjs`): WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large) or AAA (7:1/4.5:1)
- **Missing alt text**: Images without `alt`, `role`, or `aria-label`
- **Form labels**: Inputs without associated `<label>`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`
- **Heading hierarchy**: Skipped heading levels (h1 to h3 without h2)
- **Language attribute**: Missing `lang` on `<html>`
- **Page title**: Missing or empty `<title>`
- **Empty buttons**: Buttons without text or ARIA label
- **Empty links**: Links without text, ARIA label, or image with alt

### Step 6: Content Verification (Mission-Aware)

This step uses the milestone's acceptance criteria to verify specific content. It requires AI judgment — not just automated checks.

**Pattern**: Read the acceptance criteria, then use Playwright to verify each one:

```javascript
// Example: "Homepage shows product name and pricing"
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');

// Check for specific content
const bodyText = await page.evaluate(() => document.body.innerText);
const hasProductName = bodyText.includes('ProductName');
const hasPricing = bodyText.includes('$') || bodyText.includes('pricing');

// Check for specific elements
const heroExists = await page.locator('.hero, [data-testid="hero"]').count() > 0;
const ctaExists = await page.locator('a:has-text("Get Started"), button:has-text("Sign Up")').count() > 0;
```

**When Stagehand is better**: If the page structure is unknown or the acceptance criteria are vague ("page looks professional"), use Stagehand's `observe()` and `extract()` for AI-powered page understanding. But prefer Playwright for speed when you know what to look for.

## Interpreting Results for the Orchestrator

The milestone validation worker needs clear pass/fail signals. Map QA results to validation outcomes:

| Finding | Severity | Blocks Milestone? |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Page returns 5xx | Critical | Yes |
| Console error on load | Critical | Yes |
| Blank page (no content) | Critical | Yes |
| Broken internal link (404) | Major | Yes |
| Layout break at required viewport | Major | Yes |
| Missing content from acceptance criteria | Major | Yes |
| Contrast ratio failure (AA) | Major | Yes (if a11y is in criteria) |
| Missing alt text | Minor | No (note in report) |
| Heading hierarchy skip | Minor | No (note in report) |
| Console warning (not error) | Minor | No (note in report) |
| Missing form label | Minor | No (unless forms are in criteria) |

## Advanced: Visual Regression

For missions that run multiple milestones with UI changes, compare screenshots between milestones:

```bash
# Baseline (after Milestone 1 passes)
browser-qa-helper.sh screenshot --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --pages "/" --output-dir /path/to/mission/assets/baseline-m1

# After Milestone 2 features merge
browser-qa-helper.sh screenshot --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --pages "/" --output-dir /path/to/mission/assets/current-m2

# Compare (pixel diff — requires ImageMagick)
compare -metric RMSE baseline-m1/index-desktop-1440x900.png current-m2/index-desktop-1440x900.png diff.png
```

**Note**: Pixel-perfect comparison is brittle (font rendering, animation timing). Use it for detecting major layout shifts, not minor rendering differences. A diff > 5% RMSE warrants investigation.
