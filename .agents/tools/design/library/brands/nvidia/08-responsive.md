# Responsive Behavior

## Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile Small | &lt;375px | Compact single-column, reduced padding |
| Mobile | 375-425px | Standard mobile layout |
| Mobile Large | 425-600px | Wider mobile, some 2-col hints |
| Tablet Small | 600-768px | 2-column grids begin |
| Tablet | 768-1024px | Full card grids, expanded nav |
| Desktop | 1024-1350px | Standard desktop layout |
| Large Desktop | &gt;1350px | Maximum content width, generous margins |

## Touch Targets

- Buttons use 11px 13px padding for comfortable tap targets
- Navigation links at 14px uppercase with adequate spacing
- Green-bordered buttons provide high-contrast touch targets on dark backgrounds
- Mobile: hamburger menu collapse with full-screen overlay

## Collapsing Strategy

- Hero: 36px heading scales down proportionally
- Navigation: full horizontal nav collapses to hamburger menu at ~1024px
- Product cards: 3-column to 2-column to single column stacked
- Footer: multi-column grid collapses to single stacked column
- Section spacing: 64-80px reduces to 32-48px on mobile
- Images: maintain aspect ratio, scale to container width

## Image Behavior

- GPU/product renders maintain high resolution at all sizes
- Hero images scale proportionally with viewport
- Card images use consistent aspect ratios
- Full-bleed dark sections maintain edge-to-edge treatment

## Typography Scaling

- Display 36px scales to ~24px on mobile
- Section headings 24px scale to ~20px on mobile
- Body text maintains 15-16px across all breakpoints
- Button text maintains 16px for consistent tap targets

## Dark/Light Section Strategy

- Dark sections (black bg, white text) alternate with light sections (white bg, black text)
- The green accent remains consistent across both surface types
- On dark: links are white, underlines are green
- On light: links are black, underlines are green
- This alternation creates natural scroll rhythm and content grouping
