# Sonnet Tier Model (Default)

Default tier for most development work: balanced capability, cost, and speed.

## Use For

- Writing and modifying code
- Code review with actionable feedback
- Debugging and implementation reasoning
- Documentation derived from code
- Interactive development tasks
- Test writing and execution

## Routing Rules

- Default to sonnet unless the task clearly needs less or more capability.
- Route simple classification or formatting to haiku.
- Route architecture decisions and novel problems to opus.
- Route very large context needs (100K+ tokens) to pro.
