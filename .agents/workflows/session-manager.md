# Session Manager

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Detect session completion, suggest new sessions, spawn parallel work
- **Triggers**: PR merge, release, topic shift, context limits
- **Actions**: Suggest @agent-review, new session, worktree + spawn

**Key signals for session completion:**
- All session tasks marked `[x]` in TODO.md
- PR merged (`gh pr view --json state`)
- Release published (`gh release view`)
- User gratitude phrases
- Topic shift to unrelated work

## Session Completion Detection

### Automatic Signals

| Signal | Detection Method | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Tasks complete | `grep -c '^\s*- \[ \]' TODO.md` returns 0 | High |
| PR merged | `gh pr view --json state` returns "MERGED" | High |
| Release published | `gh release view` succeeds for new version | High |
| User gratitude | "thanks", "done", "that's all", "finished" | Medium |
| Topic shift | New unrelated task requested | Medium |

### Check Script

```bash
# Check session completion status
check_session_status() {
    local incomplete
    local pr_state
    local version
    local latest_tag

    echo "=== Session Status ==="

    # Check incomplete tasks
    incomplete=$(grep -c '^\s*- \[ \]' TODO.md 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    echo "Incomplete tasks: ${incomplete}"

    # Check recent PR (requires gh CLI)
    pr_state=$(gh pr view --json state --jq '.state' 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
    echo "Current PR state: ${pr_state}"

    # Check latest release vs VERSION
    version=$(<VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
    latest_tag=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
    echo "VERSION: ${version}, Latest tag: ${latest_tag}"

    # Suggest if complete
    if [[ "${incomplete}" == "0" && "${pr_state}" == "MERGED" ]]; then
        echo ""
        echo "Session appears complete. Consider:"
        echo "  1. Run @agent-review"
        echo "  2. Start new session"
    fi

    return 0
}
```

## Suggestion Templates

### After PR Merge + Release

```text
---
Session goals achieved:
- [x] {PR title} (PR #{number} merged)
- [x] v{version} released

Suggestions:
1. Run @agent-review to capture learnings
2. Start new session for next task (clean context)
3. Continue in current session

For parallel work on related feature:
  worktree-helper.sh add feature/{next-feature}
---
```

### Topic Shift Detected

```text
---
Topic shift detected: {new topic} differs from {current focus}

Suggestions:
1. Start new session for {new topic} (recommended)
2. Create worktree for parallel work
3. Continue in current session (context may become unfocused)
---
```

### Context Window Warning

When conversation becomes very long:

```text
---
This session has been running for a while with significant context.

Suggestions:
1. Run @agent-review to capture session learnings
2. Start new session with fresh context
3. Continue (risk of context degradation)
---
```

## Spawning New Sessions

### Option 1: New Terminal Tab (macOS)

```bash
# macOS Terminal.app
spawn_terminal_tab() {
    local dir="${1:-$(pwd)}"
    local cmd="${2:-opencode}"
    osascript -e "tell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"cd '${dir}' && ${cmd}\""
    return 0
}

# iTerm (responds to both "iTerm" and "iTerm2" in AppleScript)
spawn_iterm_tab() {
    local dir="${1:-$(pwd)}"
    local cmd="${2:-opencode}"
    osascript -e "tell application \"iTerm\" to tell current window to create tab with default profile command \"cd '${dir}' && ${cmd}\""
    return 0
}

# Usage (replace <your-project> with your actual project path)
spawn_terminal_tab ~/Git/<your-project>
```

### Option 2: Background Session

```bash
# Non-interactive execution
opencode run "Continue with task X" --agent Build+ &

# Persistent server for multiple sessions
opencode serve --port 4097 &
opencode run --attach http://localhost:4097 "Task description" --agent Build+
```

### Option 3: Worktree + New Session (Recommended)

Best for parallel branch work:

```bash
# Create worktree
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-helper.sh add feature/parallel-task
# Output: ~/Git/<your-project>-feature-parallel-task/

# Spawn session in worktree (macOS)
osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script "cd ~/Git/<your-project>-feature-parallel-task && opencode"'
```

### Linux Terminal Spawning

```bash
# GNOME Terminal
gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -c "cd ~/Git/<your-project> && opencode; exec bash"

# Konsole
konsole --new-tab -e bash -c "cd ~/Git/<your-project> && opencode"

# Kitty
kitty @ launch --type=tab --cwd=~/Git/<your-project> opencode
```

## Session Handoff Pattern

When spawning a continuation session:

```bash
# Export context for new session
cat > .session-handoff.md << EOF
# Session Handoff

**Previous session**: $(date)
**Branch**: $(git branch --show-current)
**Last commit**: $(git log -1 --oneline)

## Completed
- {list completed items}

## Continue With
- {next task description}

## Context
- {relevant context for continuation}
EOF

# Spawn with handoff
opencode run "Read .session-handoff.md and continue the work" --agent Build+
```

## When to Suggest @agent-review

Agents should suggest `@agent-review` at these points:

1. **After PR merge** - Document what worked in the PR process
2. **After release** - Document release learnings
3. **After fixing multiple issues** - Pattern recognition opportunity
4. **After user correction** - Immediate improvement opportunity
5. **Before starting unrelated work** - Clean context boundary
6. **After long session** - Document accumulated learnings

## Integration with Loop Agents

Loop agents (`/preflight-loop`, `/pr-loop`, `/postflight-loop`) should:

1. **Detect completion** - When loop succeeds (all checks pass, PR merged, etc.)
2. **Suggest next steps** - Offer @agent-review or new session
3. **Offer spawning** - For parallel work on next task

Example loop completion:

```text
<promise>PR_MERGED</promise>

---
Loop complete. PR #123 merged successfully.

Suggestions:
1. Run @agent-review to capture PR process learnings
2. Start new session for next task
3. Spawn parallel session: worktree-helper.sh add feature/next-feature
---
```

## Compaction Resilience (Long Autonomous Sessions)

During long autonomous sessions (1h+), context compaction can cause loss of task state. Use the checkpoint system to persist state to disk.

### Checkpoint Workflow

```bash
# After completing each task, save checkpoint:
session-checkpoint-helper.sh save \
  --task "t135.9" \
  --next "t135.11,t014,t025" \
  --worktree "/path/to/worktree" \
  --batch "batch2-quality" \
  --note "Completed trap cleanup for 29 scripts" \
  --elapsed "90" \
  --target "240"

# Before starting any new task (especially after compaction), reload:
session-checkpoint-helper.sh load

# Check if checkpoint is stale:
session-checkpoint-helper.sh status
```

### When to Checkpoint

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Task completed | `save` with updated --task and --next |
| PR created/merged | `save` with --note describing PR state |
| Batch of files committed | `save` with --note listing what changed |
| Before large operation | `save` as recovery point |
| After context compaction | `load` to re-orient |

### Self-Prompting Loop Pattern

For autonomous multi-hour sessions (interactive only, NOT headless workers), follow this loop after each task:

1. Mark task complete in TODO.md (interactive sessions only -- workers report via exit code/mailbox)
2. Save checkpoint to disk
3. Re-read checkpoint file (forces re-orientation after compaction)
4. Read TODO.md for next task
5. Start next task

This ensures the agent always has current state even if context was compacted between steps 2 and 3.

### Continuation Prompt Generation

Generate a structured continuation prompt that captures all operational state:

```bash
# Generate and display continuation prompt (for pasting into new session):
session-checkpoint-helper.sh continuation

# Auto-save checkpoint with state auto-detection (no manual flags):
session-checkpoint-helper.sh auto-save --task "t135.9" --note "Completed X"

# Include operational state in session distillation:
session-distill-helper.sh auto    # Now includes checkpoint step
session-distill-helper.sh checkpoint  # Just the operational state
```

The continuation prompt gathers state from multiple sources:

- **Git**: branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, worktrees
- **GitHub**: open PRs for the repo
- **Supervisor**: active batch state
- **TODO.md**: in-progress tasks
- **Checkpoint file**: last saved context note
- **Memory**: recent session memories

This is the single highest-impact factor for session continuity. AGENTS.md provides the "how" (conventions, tools), but the continuation prompt provides the "where we are" (task states, batch IDs, next steps).
