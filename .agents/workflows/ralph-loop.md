# Ralph Loop v2 - Iterative AI Development

Implementation of the Ralph Wiggum technique for iterative, self-referential AI development loops.

Based on [Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/), enhanced with [flow-next architecture](https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace/tree/main/plugins/flow-next) for fresh context per iteration.

## v2 Architecture

The v2 implementation addresses context drift by using:

- **Fresh context per iteration** - External bash loop spawns new AI sessions
- **File I/O as state** - JSON state files, not conversation transcript
- **Re-anchor every iteration** - Re-read TODO.md, git state, memories
- **Receipt-based verification** - Proof of work for each iteration
- **Memory integration** - SQLite FTS5 for cross-session learning

This follows Anthropic's own guidance: "agents must re-anchor from sources of truth to prevent drift."

## What is Ralph?

Ralph is a development methodology based on continuous AI agent loops. The core concept:

> "Ralph is a Bash loop" - a simple `while true` that repeatedly feeds an AI agent a prompt, allowing it to iteratively improve its work until completion.

The technique is named after Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, embodying the philosophy of persistent iteration despite setbacks.

## How It Works

```text
1. User starts loop with prompt and completion criteria
2. AI works on the task
3. AI tries to exit/complete
4. Loop checks for completion promise
5. If not complete: feed SAME prompt back
6. AI sees previous work in files/git
7. Repeat until completion or max iterations
```

The loop creates a **self-referential feedback loop** where:

- The prompt never changes between iterations
- Claude's previous work persists in files
- Each iteration sees modified files and git history
- Claude autonomously improves by reading its own past work

**Evolving draft agents**: When a loop iteration discovers reusable domain patterns (validation rules, API conventions, testing strategies), capture them as a draft agent in `~/.aidevops/agents/draft/`. Subsequent iterations and future loops can reference the draft instead of rediscovering the pattern. After the loop completes, log a TODO to review the draft for promotion to `custom/` (private) or `.agents/` (shared via PR). See `tools/build-agent/build-agent.md` "Agent Lifecycle Tiers".

## Quick Start

### v2: Fresh Sessions (Recommended)

> **Note:** `ralph-loop-helper.sh` has been archived (t1336). Use `/full-loop` for
> end-to-end development, or the `/ralph-loop` slash command for in-session loops.

```bash
# End-to-end development loop (recommended)
/full-loop "Build a REST API for todos"

# Or use the slash command for in-session iteration
/ralph-loop "Build a REST API for todos" --max-iterations 20 --completion-promise "TASK_COMPLETE"
```

### Auto-Branch Handling (Loop Mode)

When running in loop mode on main/master, Ralph automatically handles branch decisions:

```bash
# The helper script checks branch and auto-decides
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/pre-edit-check.sh --loop-mode --task "Build a REST API for todos"
```

**Auto-decision rules:**

| Task Type | Detection Keywords | Action |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Docs-only | readme, changelog, docs/, documentation, typo, spelling | Stay on main (exit 0) |
| Code | feature, fix, bug, implement, refactor, add, update, enhance | Create worktree (exit 2) |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Proceed (on feature branch or docs-only on main)
- `2` - Create worktree (code task detected on main)
- `1` - Error (shouldn't occur in loop mode)

This eliminates the interactive prompt that previously stalled loop agents.

### Legacy: Same Session

```bash
# For tools with hook support (Claude Code)
/ralph-loop "Build a REST API" --max-iterations 50 --completion-promise "COMPLETE"

# Cancel
/cancel-ralph
```

## Commands

### ralph-loop-helper.sh run (v2) — ARCHIVED

> **Archived (t1336):** This script has been moved to `scripts/archived/ralph-loop-helper.sh`.
> Use `/full-loop` or `/ralph-loop` slash commands instead.

**Original usage (for reference):**

```bash
ralph-loop-helper.sh run "<prompt>" --tool <tool> [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--tool <name>` | AI CLI tool (opencode, claude, aider) | opencode |
| `--max-iterations <n>` | Stop after N iterations | 50 |
| `--completion-promise <text>` | Phrase that signals completion | TASK_COMPLETE |
| `--max-attempts <n>` | Block task after N failures | 5 |
| `--task-id <id>` | Task ID for tracking | auto-generated |

### /ralph-loop (Legacy)

Start a Ralph loop in same session (for tools with hook support).

**Usage:**

```bash
/ralph-loop "<prompt>" [--max-iterations <n>] [--completion-promise "<text>"]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--max-iterations <n>` | Stop after N iterations | unlimited |
| `--completion-promise <text>` | Phrase that signals completion | none |

### /cancel-ralph

Cancel the active Ralph loop.

**Usage:**

```bash
/cancel-ralph
```

## State File

Ralph stores its state in `.agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md` (gitignored):

```yaml
---
active: true
iteration: 5
max_iterations: 50
completion_promise: "COMPLETE"
started_at: "2025-01-08T10:30:00Z"
---

Your original prompt here...
```

## Completion Promise

To signal completion, output the exact text in `<promise>` tags:

```text
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

**Critical Rules:**

- Use `<promise>` XML tags exactly as shown
- The statement MUST be completely and unequivocally TRUE
- Do NOT output false statements to exit the loop
- Do NOT lie even if you think you should exit

## Prompt Writing Best Practices

### 1. Clear Completion Criteria

**Bad:**

```text
Build a todo API and make it good.
```

**Good:**

```text
Build a REST API for todos.

When complete:
- All CRUD endpoints working
- Input validation in place
- Tests passing (coverage > 80%)
- README with API docs
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

### 2. Incremental Goals

**Bad:**

```text
Create a complete e-commerce platform.
```

**Good:**

```text
Phase 1: User authentication (JWT, tests)
Phase 2: Product catalog (list/search, tests)
Phase 3: Shopping cart (add/remove, tests)

Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when all phases done.
```

### 3. Self-Correction

**Bad:**

```text
Write code for feature X.
```

**Good:**

```text
Implement feature X following TDD:
1. Write failing tests
2. Implement feature
3. Run tests
4. If any fail, debug and fix
5. Refactor if needed
6. Repeat until all green
7. Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

### 4. Documentation Updates (MANDATORY gate)

**Before emitting COMPLETE**, check the README gate (enforced in full-loop Step 3):

1. Did this task add a new feature, tool, API, command, or config option? → **Update README.md**
2. Did this task change existing user-facing behavior? → **Update README.md**
3. Pure refactor, bugfix with no behavior change, or internal-only? → **SKIP**

**README updates** - When adding features, APIs, or changing behavior:

```text
Implement feature X.

When complete:
- Feature working with tests
- README.md updated with usage examples (MANDATORY if user-facing)
- For aidevops: readme-helper.sh check passes
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

**Changelog via commits** - Use conventional commit messages for auto-generated changelogs:

```text
# Good commit messages (auto-included in changelog)
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve memory leak in connection pool
docs: update API documentation

# Excluded from changelog
chore: update dependencies
```

The release workflow auto-generates CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits. See `workflows/changelog.md`.

### 5. Escape Hatches

Always use `--max-iterations` as a safety net:

```bash
# Recommended: Always set a reasonable iteration limit
/ralph-loop "Try to implement feature X" --max-iterations 20

# In your prompt, include what to do if stuck:
# "After 15 iterations, if not complete:
#  - Document what's blocking progress
#  - List what was attempted
#  - Suggest alternative approaches"
```

### 6. Replanning (don't patch a broken approach)

If you've spent 3+ iterations on the same sub-problem without progress, STOP patching and replan from scratch. Read the task description fresh, examine what you've built so far, and consider a fundamentally different approach. The loop gives you fresh context each iteration — use it.

**Signs you need to replan:**

- Same error recurring across iterations despite fixes
- Incremental patches making the code more complex without solving the root issue
- Tests still failing after 3+ attempts at the same approach

**How to replan:**

1. Acknowledge the current approach isn't working
2. List what you've learned about the problem from failed attempts
3. Identify at least one fundamentally different strategy
4. Start the new approach cleanly — don't build on the broken foundation

A fresh strategy beats incremental fixes to a broken approach. Sunk cost is not a reason to continue.

## When to Use Ralph

**Good for:**

- Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria
- Tasks requiring iteration and refinement (e.g., getting tests to pass)
- Greenfield projects where you can walk away
- Tasks with automatic verification (tests, linters)

**Not good for:**

- Tasks requiring human judgment or design decisions
- One-shot operations
- Tasks with unclear success criteria
- Production debugging (use targeted debugging instead)

## Philosophy

### 1. Context Pollution Prevention

Every AI session has a context window (working memory). As you work:
- Files read, commands run, outputs produced all accumulate
- Wrong turns and half-baked plans stay in context
- **You can keep adding, but you can't delete**

Eventually you hit the familiar symptom cluster:
- Repeating itself
- "Fixing" the same bug in slightly different ways
- Confidently undoing its own previous fix
- Circular reasoning

That's **context pollution**. Once you're there, "try harder" doesn't work.

Ralph doesn't try to clean the memory. It throws it away and starts fresh.

### 2. Progress Persists, Failures Don't

The trick is simple: **externalize state**.

| Context (bad for state) | Files + Git (good for state) |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Dies with the conversation | Only what you choose to write |
| Persists forever in session | Can be patched / rolled back |
| Polluted by dead ends | Git doesn't hallucinate |

Each fresh agent starts clean, then reconstructs reality from files.

### 3. Guardrails: Same Mistake Never Happens Twice

Ralph will do something stupid. The win condition is not "no mistakes."

**The win condition is the same mistake never happens twice.**

When something breaks, the loop stores it as a guardrail (sign):

```markdown
### Sign: check imports before adding
- trigger: adding a new import statement
- instruction: check if import already exists
- added after: iteration 3 (duplicate import broke build)
```

Guardrails are append-only. Mistakes evaporate from context. Lessons accumulate in files.

Next iteration reads guardrails first. Cheap. Brutal. Effective.

### 4. Iteration > Perfection

Don't aim for perfect on first try. Let the loop refine the work.

### 5. Failures Are Data

"Deterministically bad" means failures are predictable and informative. Use them to tune prompts.

### 6. Operator Skill Matters

Success depends on writing good prompts, not just having a good model.

### 7. Persistence Wins

Keep trying until success. The loop handles retry logic automatically.

## Cross-Tool Compatibility

This implementation works with:

| Tool | Method |
|------|--------|
| Claude Code | Native plugin (ralph-wiggum) |
| OpenCode | `/ralph-loop` command + helper script |
| Other AI CLIs | Helper script with manual loop |

### For Tools Without Hook Support

Use `/full-loop` which handles the complete lifecycle including fresh sessions:

```bash
# Full development loop (works with any AI CLI)
/full-loop "Your prompt here"
```

## Monitoring

```bash
# View current iteration
grep '^iteration:' .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md

# View full state
head -10 .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md

# Check if loop is active
test -f .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md && echo "Active" || echo "Not active"
```

## Multi-Worktree Awareness

When working with git worktrees, Ralph loops are aware of parallel sessions.

### Check All Worktrees

```bash
# Show active worktrees and their sessions
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-sessions.sh list
```

Output shows branch name, session status, and loop state for each worktree.

### Integration with worktree-sessions.sh

The worktree session mapper shows Ralph loop status:

```bash
# List all worktrees with their sessions and loop status
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-sessions.sh list
```

Output includes a "Ralph loop: iteration X/Y" line for worktrees with active loops.

## CI/CD Wait Time Optimization

When using Ralph loops with PR review workflows, the loop uses adaptive timing based on observed CI/CD service completion times.

### Evidence-Based Timing (from PR #19 analysis)

| Service Category | Services | Typical Time | Initial Wait | Poll Interval |
|------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Fast** | CodeFactor, Version, Framework | 1-5s | 10s | 5s |
| **Medium** | SonarCloud, Codacy, Qlty | 43-62s | 60s | 15s |
| **Slow** | CodeRabbit | 120-180s | 120s | 30s |

### Adaptive Waiting Strategy

The `/full-loop` and `/pr-loop` commands use adaptive timing:

1. **Service-aware initial wait**: Waits based on the slowest pending check
2. **Exponential backoff**: Increases wait time between iterations (15s → 30s → 60s → 120s max)
3. **Hybrid approach**: Uses the larger of backoff or adaptive wait

### Customizing Timing

Edit `.agents/scripts/shared-constants.sh` to adjust timing constants:

```bash
# Fast checks
readonly CI_WAIT_FAST=10
readonly CI_POLL_FAST=5

# Medium checks
readonly CI_WAIT_MEDIUM=60
readonly CI_POLL_MEDIUM=15

# Slow checks (CodeRabbit)
readonly CI_WAIT_SLOW=120
readonly CI_POLL_SLOW=30

# Backoff settings
readonly CI_BACKOFF_BASE=15
readonly CI_BACKOFF_MAX=120
```

### Gathering Your Own Timing Data

To optimize for your specific CI/CD setup:

1. Run `gh run list --limit 10 --json name,updatedAt,createdAt` to see workflow durations
2. Check PR check completion times in GitHub UI
3. Update constants in `shared-constants.sh` based on your observations

## Real-World Results

From the original Ralph technique:

- Successfully generated 6 repositories overnight in Y Combinator hackathon testing
- One $50k contract completed for $297 in API costs
- Created entire programming language ("cursed") over 3 months using this approach

## Upstream Sync

This is an **independent implementation** inspired by the Claude Code ralph-wiggum plugin, not a mirror. We maintain our own codebase for cross-tool compatibility.

**Check for upstream changes:**

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/ralph-upstream-check.sh
```

This compares our implementation against the Claude plugin and reports any significant differences or new features we might want to incorporate.

The check runs automatically when starting an OpenCode session in the aidevops repository.

## Session Completion & Spawning

Loop agents should detect completion and suggest next steps. See `workflows/session-manager.md` for the canonical reference on session lifecycle, completion detection, spawning patterns (terminal tabs, background sessions, worktrees), and handoff templates.

**Quick reference for loop completion:**

```bash
# After successful loop, start next task
/full-loop "Next task description"

# Or spawn a background session
opencode run "Continue with next task" --agent Build+ &
```

## Full Development Loop

For end-to-end automation from task conception to deployment, use the Full Development Loop orchestrator. This chains all phases together for maximum AI utility.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start full loop
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh start "Implement feature X with tests"

# Check status
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh status

# Resume after manual intervention
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh resume

# Cancel if needed
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/full-loop-helper.sh cancel
```

### Loop Phases

```text

┌─────────────────┐
│  6. DEPLOY      │  Run setup.sh
│  (Local Setup)  │  Promise: DEPLOYED
└─────────────────┘
```

| Phase | Method | Promise | Auto-Trigger |
|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Task Development | `/full-loop` | `TASK_COMPLETE` | Manual start |
| Preflight | `linters-local.sh` + AI fixes | `PREFLIGHT_PASS` | After task |
| PR Creation | `gh pr create` | (PR URL) | After preflight |
| PR Review | `/pr-loop` (AI monitors CI + reviews) | `PR_MERGED` | After PR create |
| Postflight | `/postflight-loop` (AI checks release) | `RELEASE_HEALTHY` | After merge |
| Deploy | `./setup.sh` (aidevops only) | `DEPLOYED` | After postflight |

### Human Decision Points

The loop is designed for maximum AI autonomy while preserving human control at strategic points:

| Phase | AI Autonomous | Human Required |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Task Development | Code changes, iterations, fixes, README updates | Initial task definition, scope decisions |
| Preflight | Auto-fix, re-run checks | Override to skip (emergency only) |
| PR Creation | Auto-create with `--fill` | Custom title/description if needed |
| PR Review | Address feedback, push fixes | Approve/merge (if required by repo) |
| Postflight | Monitor, report issues | Rollback decision if issues found |
| Deploy | Run `setup.sh` | None (fully autonomous) |

### Documentation in Loops

**README gate (MANDATORY)**: Before declaring task complete, the AI MUST check:

1. Did this task add/change user-facing features, tools, APIs, or commands?
2. If YES → Update README.md before proceeding (use `/readme --sections` for targeted updates)
3. For aidevops repo → Also run `readme-helper.sh check` for stale counts

This is a gate between task development and preflight, not a suggestion. See `scripts/commands/full-loop.md` Step 3 completion criteria.

**Changelog**: Auto-generated from conventional commits during release. Use proper prefixes:
- `feat:` → Added section
- `fix:` → Fixed section
- `docs:` → Changed section
- `chore:` → Excluded from changelog

See `workflows/changelog.md` for details.

### Options

```bash
full-loop-helper.sh start "<prompt>" [options]

Options:
  --max-task-iterations N       Max iterations for task (default: 50)
  --max-preflight-iterations N  Max iterations for preflight (default: 5)
  --max-pr-iterations N         Max iterations for PR review (default: 20)
  --skip-preflight              Skip preflight checks (not recommended)
  --skip-postflight             Skip postflight monitoring
  --no-auto-pr                  Don't auto-create PR, pause for human
  --no-auto-deploy              Don't auto-run setup.sh (aidevops only)
  --dry-run                     Show what would happen without executing
```

### aidevops-Specific Behavior

When working in the aidevops repository (detected by repo name or `.aidevops-repo` marker), the full loop automatically runs `setup.sh` after successful postflight to deploy changes locally.

```bash
# In aidevops repo, this will auto-deploy
full-loop-helper.sh start "Add new helper script"

# Disable auto-deploy if needed
full-loop-helper.sh start "Add new helper script" --no-auto-deploy
```

### State Management

The full loop maintains state in `.agents/loop-state/full-loop.local.md` (gitignored), allowing:

- Resume after interruption
- Track current phase
- Preserve PR number across phases

```bash
# Check current state
cat .agents/loop-state/full-loop.local.md

# Resume from where you left off
full-loop-helper.sh resume
```

## OpenProse Integration

For complex multi-agent orchestration within Ralph loops, consider using OpenProse DSL patterns. OpenProse provides explicit control flow that complements Ralph's iterative approach.

### Parallel Reviews Pattern

Instead of sequential reviews, use OpenProse-style parallel blocks:

```prose
# Traditional sequential
session "Security review"
session "Performance review"
session "Style review"
session "Synthesize"

# OpenProse parallel pattern
parallel:
  security = session "Security review"
  perf = session "Performance review"
  style = session "Style review"

session "Synthesize all reviews"
  context: { security, perf, style }
```

### AI-Evaluated Conditions

OpenProse's discretion markers (`**...**`) provide cleaner condition syntax:

```prose
loop until **all tests pass and code coverage exceeds 80%** (max: 20):
  session "Run tests, analyze failures, fix bugs"
```

### Error Recovery

OpenProse's `try/catch/retry` semantics for resilient loops:

```prose
loop until **task complete** (max: 50):
  try:
    session "Attempt implementation"
      retry: 3
      backoff: "exponential"
  catch as err:
    session "Analyze failure and adjust approach"
      context: err
```

### When to Use OpenProse vs Native Ralph

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Simple iterative task | Native Ralph loop |
| Multi-agent parallel work | OpenProse `parallel:` blocks |
| Complex conditional logic | OpenProse `if`/`choice` blocks |
| Error recovery workflows | OpenProse `try/catch/retry` |

See `tools/ai-orchestration/openprose.md` for full OpenProse documentation.
