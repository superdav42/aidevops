# Plans Workflow

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Save planning discussions as actionable tasks or plans
- **Commands**: `/save-todo` (auto-detects), `/ready` (show unblocked), `/sync-beads` (sync to Beads)
- **Principle**: Don't make user think about where to save

**Files**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TODO.md` | All tasks (simple + plan references) with dependencies |
| `todo/PLANS.md` | Complex execution plans with context |
| `todo/tasks/prd-{name}.md` | Product requirement documents |
| `todo/tasks/tasks-{name}.md` | Implementation task lists |
| `.beads/` | Beads database (synced from TODO.md) |

**Task ID Format**:

| Pattern | Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `tNNN` | `t001` | Top-level task |
| `tNNN.N` | `t001.1` | Subtask |
| `tNNN.N.N` | `t001.1.1` | Sub-subtask |

**Dependency Syntax**:

| Field | Example | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `blocked-by:` | `blocked-by:t001,t002` | Cannot start until these are done |
| `blocks:` | `blocks:t003` | Completing this unblocks these |
| Indentation | 2 spaces | Parent-child relationship |

**Workflow**:

```text
Planning Conversation → /save-todo → Auto-detect → Save appropriately
                                                         ↓
Future Session → "Work on X" → Load context → git-workflow.md
                                                         ↓
                              /ready → Show unblocked tasks
                                                         ↓
                              /sync-beads → Sync to Beads for graph view
```

## Auto-Detection Logic

When `/save-todo` is invoked, analyze the conversation for complexity signals:

| Signal | Indicates | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Single action item | Simple | TODO.md only |
| < 2 hour estimate | Simple | TODO.md only |
| User says "quick" or "simple" | Simple | TODO.md only |
| Multiple distinct steps | Complex | PLANS.md + TODO.md |
| Research/design needed | Complex | PLANS.md + TODO.md |
| > 2 hour estimate | Complex | PLANS.md + TODO.md |
| Multi-session work | Complex | PLANS.md + TODO.md |
| PRD mentioned or needed | Complex | PLANS.md + TODO.md + PRD |

## Ralph Classification

Tasks can be classified as "Ralph-able" - suitable for autonomous iterative AI loops.

### Ralph Criteria

A task is Ralph-able when it has:

| Criterion | Required | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Clear success criteria** | Yes | "All tests pass", "Zero linting errors" |
| **Automated verification** | Yes | Tests, linters, type checkers |
| **Bounded scope** | Yes | Single feature, specific bug fix |
| **No human judgment needed** | Yes | No design decisions, no UX choices |
| **Deterministic outcome** | Preferred | Same input → same expected output |

### Ralph Signals in Conversation

| Signal | Ralph-able? | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| "Make all tests pass" | Yes | Clear, verifiable |
| "Fix linting errors" | Yes | Automated verification |
| "Implement feature X with tests" | Yes | Tests provide verification |
| "Refactor until clean" | Maybe | Needs specific criteria |
| "Make it look better" | No | Subjective, needs human judgment |
| "Design the API" | No | Requires design decisions |
| "Debug production issue" | No | Unpredictable, needs investigation |

### Tagging Ralph-able Tasks

When a task meets Ralph criteria, add the `#ralph` tag:

```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix all ShellCheck violations in scripts/ #ralph ~1h
- [ ] t043 Implement user auth with tests #ralph #feature ~2h
- [ ] t044 Design new dashboard layout #feature ~2h  (NOT ralph-able)
```

### Auto-Dispatch Tagging

When creating TODO entries, assess whether the task can run autonomously without user monitoring. If yes, add `#auto-dispatch`. The supervisor's Phase 0 picks these up automatically on the next cron pulse.

**Add `#auto-dispatch` when ALL of these are true:**
- Clear fix/feature description with specific files or patterns to change
- Bounded scope (~1h or less estimated — most tasks complete in ~30m)
- No user credentials, accounts, or purchases needed
- No design decisions requiring user preference
- Verification is automatable (tests, ShellCheck, syntax check, browser test)

**Do NOT add `#auto-dispatch` when ANY of these are true:**
- Task requires user to provide credentials, top up accounts, or make purchases
- Task is a `#plan` that needs decomposition into subtasks first
- Task requires hardware setup or external service configuration
- Task description says "investigate" or "evaluate" without a clear deliverable
- Task has `blocked-by:` dependencies on incomplete tasks

**Examples:**

```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix ShellCheck violations in helper.sh #bugfix #auto-dispatch ~30m
- [ ] t043 Add download --count flag to automator #enhancement #auto-dispatch ~1h
- [ ] t044 Investigate API pricing tiers #investigation ~30m  (NOT auto-dispatch)
- [ ] t045 Design new dashboard layout #plan ~3h  (NOT auto-dispatch — needs decomposition)
```

**AI agents MUST**: When creating a new TODO entry, always evaluate auto-dispatch eligibility and add the tag if criteria are met. Default to including `#auto-dispatch` — only omit when a specific exclusion criterion applies. The goal is to keep the autonomous pipeline moving.

### Ralph Task Requirements

When tagging a task as `#ralph`, ensure it includes:

1. **Completion promise**: What phrase signals success
2. **Verification command**: How to check if done
3. **Max iterations**: Safety limit (default: 20)

**Full format:**

```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix all ShellCheck violations #ralph ~1h
  ralph-promise: "SHELLCHECK_CLEAN"
  ralph-verify: "shellcheck .agents/scripts/*.sh"
  ralph-max: 10
```

**Shorthand** (for simple cases):

```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix all ShellCheck violations #ralph(SHELLCHECK_CLEAN) ~1h
```

### Running Ralph Tasks

```bash
# Start a Ralph loop for a tagged task
/ralph-loop "$(grep 't042' TODO.md)" --completion-promise "SHELLCHECK_CLEAN" --max-iterations 10

# Or use the task ID directly
/ralph-task t042
```

### Ralph in PLANS.md

For complex plans, mark Ralph-able phases:

```markdown
#### Progress

- [ ] Phase 1: Research API endpoints ~30m
- [ ] Phase 2: Implement core logic #ralph ~1h
  ralph-promise: "ALL_TESTS_PASS"
  ralph-verify: "npm test"
- [ ] Phase 3: Design UI components ~1h (requires human review)
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration tests #ralph ~30m
  ralph-promise: "INTEGRATION_PASS"
  ralph-verify: "npm run test:integration"
```

### Quality Loop Integration

Built-in Ralph-able workflows:

| Workflow | Command | Promise |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Preflight | `/preflight-loop` | `PREFLIGHT_PASS` |
| PR Review | `/pr-loop` | `PR_APPROVED` |
| Postflight | `/postflight-loop` | `RELEASE_HEALTHY` |

These use the Ralph loop pattern for iterative quality checks. The AI reads check output and fixes issues intelligently rather than using mechanical retry loops.

## Saving Work

### MANDATORY: Task Brief Requirement

**Every task MUST have a brief file** at `todo/tasks/{task_id}-brief.md`. A task without a brief is undevelopable — it loses the conversation context that informed it.

Use `templates/brief-template.md`. The brief captures:
- **Origin**: session ID, date, author, conversation context
- **What**: clear deliverable (not "implement X" but what it produces)
- **Why**: problem, user need, business value
- **How**: technical approach, file references, patterns
- **Acceptance criteria**: specific, testable conditions
- **Context & decisions**: from the conversation that created the task

**Session provenance is mandatory.** Every brief must link back to the session that created it. Detect runtime: `$OPENCODE_SESSION_ID`, `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, or `{app}:unknown-{date}`.

### Step 1: Extract from Conversation

- **Title**: Concise task/plan name
- **Description**: What needs to be done
- **Estimate**: Time estimate with breakdown `~Xh (ai:Xh test:Xh read:Xm)`
- **Tags**: Relevant categories (#seo, #security, #feature, etc.)
- **Context**: Key decisions, research findings, constraints discussed
- **Session**: Current session ID for audit trail

### Step 2: Present with Auto-Detection

**For Simple tasks:**

```text
Saving to TODO.md: "{title}" ~{estimate}

Creating brief: todo/tasks/{task_id}-brief.md
- What: {deliverable summary}
- Why: {problem/need}
- Acceptance: {key criteria}

1. Confirm (creates brief + TODO entry)
2. Add more details to brief first
3. Create full plan instead (PLANS.md)
```

**For Complex work:**

```text
This looks like complex work. Creating execution plan.

Title: {title}
Estimate: ~{estimate}
Phases: {count} identified

Creating brief: todo/tasks/{task_id}-brief.md
(Full context from this conversation will be captured)

1. Confirm and create plan + brief
2. Simplify to TODO.md + brief only
3. Add more context first
```

### Step 3: Save Appropriately

#### Simple Save (TODO.md + brief)

1. **Create brief** at `todo/tasks/{task_id}-brief.md` from conversation context
2. **Add to TODO.md** Backlog:

```markdown
## Backlog

- [ ] t{NNN} {title} #{tag} ~{estimate} logged:{YYYY-MM-DD}
```

**Format elements** (all optional except id and description):
- `t{NNN}` - Unique task ID (auto-generated, never reused)
- `@owner` - Who should work on this
- `#tag` - Category (seo, security, browser, etc.)
- `~estimate` - AI-assisted execution time (see `reference/planning-detail.md` "Estimation Calibration" for tiers: ~15m trivial, ~30m small, ~1h medium, ~2h large, ~4h major)
- `logged:YYYY-MM-DD` - Auto-added when task created
- `blocked-by:t001,t002` - Dependencies (cannot start until these done)
- `blocks:t003` - What this unblocks when complete

**Auto-dispatch gate**: Only add `#auto-dispatch` if the brief has at least 2 specific acceptance criteria, a non-empty How section with file references, and a clear What section. Thin briefs = no auto-dispatch.

Respond:

```text
Saved: "{title}" to TODO.md (~{estimate})
Brief: todo/tasks/{task_id}-brief.md
Start anytime with: "Let's work on {title}"
```

#### Complex Save (PLANS.md + TODO.md)

1. **Create PLANS.md entry**:

```markdown
### [{YYYY-MM-DD}] {Title}

**Status:** Planning
**Estimate:** ~{estimate}
**PRD:** [todo/tasks/prd-{slug}.md](tasks/prd-{slug}.md) (if needed)
**Tasks:** [todo/tasks/tasks-{slug}.md](tasks/tasks-{slug}.md) (if needed)

#### Purpose

{Why this work matters - from conversation context}

#### Progress

- [ ] ({timestamp}) Phase 1: {description} ~{est}
- [ ] ({timestamp}) Phase 2: {description} ~{est}

#### Context from Discussion

{Key decisions, research findings, constraints from conversation}

#### Decision Log

(To be populated during implementation)

#### Surprises & Discoveries

(To be populated during implementation)
```

2. **Add reference to TODO.md** (bidirectional linking):

```markdown
- [ ] {title} #plan → [todo/PLANS.md#{slug}] ~{estimate} logged:{YYYY-MM-DD}
```

3. **Optionally create PRD/tasks** if scope warrants (use `/create-prd`, `/generate-tasks`)

Respond:

```text
Saved: "{title}"
- Plan: todo/PLANS.md
- Reference: TODO.md
{- PRD: todo/tasks/prd-{slug}.md (if created)}
{- Tasks: todo/tasks/tasks-{slug}.md (if created)}

Start anytime with: "Let's work on {title}"
```

## Context Preservation

Always capture from the conversation:
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Research findings
- Constraints identified
- Open questions
- Related links or references mentioned

This context goes into the PLANS.md entry under "Context from Discussion" so future sessions have full context.

## Starting Work from Plans

When user says "Let's work on X" or references a task/plan:

### 1. Find Matching Work

```bash
grep -i "{keyword}" TODO.md
grep -i "{keyword}" todo/PLANS.md
ls todo/tasks/*{keyword}* 2>/dev/null
```

### 2. Load Context

If PRD/tasks exist, read them for full context.

### 3. Present with Auto-Selection

```text
Found: "{title}" (~{estimate})

1. Start working (creates branch: {suggested-branch})
2. View full details first
3. Different task

[Enter] or 1 to start
```

### 4. Follow git-workflow.md

After branch creation, follow standard git workflow.

## During Implementation

### Update Progress

After each work session, update `todo/PLANS.md`:

```markdown
#### Progress

- [x] (2025-01-14 10:00Z) Research API endpoints
- [x] (2025-01-14 14:00Z) Create MCP server skeleton
- [ ] (2025-01-15 09:00Z) Implement core tools ← IN PROGRESS
```

### Record Decisions

When making significant choices:

```markdown
#### Decision Log

- **Decision:** Use TypeScript + Bun stack
  **Rationale:** Matches existing MCP patterns, faster builds
  **Date:** 2025-01-14
```

### Note Surprises

When discovering unexpected information:

```markdown
#### Surprises & Discoveries

- **Observation:** Ahrefs rate limits are per-minute, not per-day
  **Evidence:** API docs state 500 requests/minute
  **Impact:** Need to implement request queuing
```

### Check Off Tasks

Update `todo/tasks/tasks-{slug}.md` as work completes:

```markdown
- [x] 1.1 Research API endpoints
- [x] 1.2 Document authentication flow
- [ ] 1.3 Implement auth handler ← CURRENT
```

## Completing a Plan

### 1. Mark Tasks Complete

Ensure all tasks in `todo/tasks/tasks-{slug}.md` are checked.

### 2. Record Time

At commit time, offer time tracking:

```text
Committing: "{title}"
Session duration: 2h 12m
Estimated: ~4h

1. Accept 2h 12m as actual
2. Enter different time
3. Skip time tracking
```

### 3. Update PLANS.md Status

```markdown
**Status:** Completed

#### Outcomes & Retrospective

**What was delivered:**
- {Deliverable 1}
- {Deliverable 2}

**Time Summary:**
- Estimated: 4h
- Actual: 3h 15m
- Variance: -19%
```

### 4. Update TODO.md

Mark the reference task done:

```markdown
## Done

- [x] {title} #plan → [todo/PLANS.md#{slug}] ~4h actual:3h15m completed:2025-01-15
```

### 5. Update CHANGELOG.md

Add entry following `workflows/changelog.md` format.

## PRD and Task Generation

For complex work that needs detailed planning:

### Generate PRD (`/create-prd`)

Ask clarifying questions using numbered options:

```text
To create the PRD, I need to clarify:

1. What is the primary goal?
   A. {option}
   B. {option}

2. Who is the target user?
   A. {option}
   B. {option}

Reply with "1A, 2B" or provide details.
```

Create PRD in `todo/tasks/prd-{slug}.md` using `templates/prd-template.md`.

### Generate Tasks (`/generate-tasks`)

**Phase 1: Parent Tasks**

```text
High-level tasks with estimates:

- [ ] 0.0 Create feature branch ~5m
- [ ] 1.0 {First major task} ~2h
- [ ] 2.0 {Second major task} ~3h

Total: ~5h 5m

Reply "Go" to generate sub-tasks.
```

**Phase 2: Sub-Tasks**

```markdown
- [ ] 0.0 Create feature branch
  - [ ] 0.1 Create and checkout: `git checkout -b feature/{slug}`

- [ ] 1.0 {First major task}
  - [ ] 1.1 {Sub-task}
  - [ ] 1.2 {Sub-task}
```

Create in `todo/tasks/tasks-{slug}.md` using `templates/tasks-template.md`.

## Time Estimation Heuristics

| Task Type | AI Time | Test Time | Read Time |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Simple fix | 15-30m | 10-15m | 5m |
| New function | 30m-1h | 15-30m | 10m |
| New component | 1-2h | 30m-1h | 15m |
| New feature | 2-4h | 1-2h | 30m |
| Architecture change | 4-8h | 2-4h | 1h |
| Research/spike | 1-2h | - | 30m |

## Dependencies and Blocking

### Dependency Syntax

Tasks can declare dependencies using these fields:

```markdown
- [ ] t001 Parent task ~4h
  - [ ] t001.1 Subtask ~2h blocked-by:t002
    - [ ] t001.1.1 Sub-subtask ~1h
  - [ ] t001.2 Another subtask ~1h blocks:t003
```

| Field | Syntax | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `blocked-by:` | `blocked-by:t001,t002` | Cannot start until t001 AND t002 are done |
| `blocks:` | `blocks:t003,t004` | Completing this task unblocks t003 and t004 |
| Indentation | 2 spaces per level | Implicit parent-child relationship |

### TOON Dependencies Block

Dependencies are also stored in machine-readable TOON format:

```markdown
<!--TOON:dependencies[N]{from_id,to_id,type}:
t019.2,t019.1,blocked-by
t019.3,t019.2,blocked-by
t020,t019,blocked-by
-->
```

### /ready Command

Show tasks with no open blockers (ready to work on):

```bash
# Invoked via AI assistant
/ready

# Or via script
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/todo-ready.sh
```

Output:

```text
Ready to work (no blockers):

1. t011 Demote wordpress.md from main agent to subagent ~1h
2. t014 Document RapidFuzz library ~30m
3. t004 Add Ahrefs MCP server integration ~2d

Blocked (waiting on dependencies):

- t019.2 Phase 2: Bi-directional sync (blocked-by: t019.1)
- t020 Git Issues Sync (blocked-by: t019)
```

### Hierarchical Task IDs

Tasks use stable, hierarchical IDs that are never reused:

| Level | Pattern | Example | Use Case |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| Top-level | `tNNN` | `t001` | Independent tasks |
| Subtask | `tNNN.N` | `t001.1` | Phases, components |
| Sub-subtask | `tNNN.N.N` | `t001.1.1` | Detailed steps |

**Rules:**
- IDs are assigned sequentially and never reused
- Subtasks inherit parent's ID as prefix
- Maximum depth: 3 levels (t001.1.1)
- IDs are stable across syncs with Beads

## Beads Integration

### Sync with Beads

aidevops Tasks & Plans syncs bi-directionally with [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for graph visualization and analytics.

```bash
# Sync TODO.md → Beads
/sync-beads push

# Sync Beads → TODO.md
/sync-beads pull

# Two-way sync with conflict detection
/sync-beads

# Or via script
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/beads-sync-helper.sh [push|pull|sync]
```

### Sync Guarantees

| Guarantee | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| No race conditions | Lock file during sync |
| Data integrity | Checksum verification before/after |
| Conflict detection | Warns if both sides changed |
| Audit trail | All syncs logged to `.beads/sync.log` |
| Command-led only | No automatic sync (user controls timing) |

### Beads UIs

After syncing, use Beads ecosystem for visualization:

| UI | Command | Best For |
|----|---------|----------|
| beads_viewer | `bv` | Graph analytics, PageRank, critical path |
| beads-ui | `npx beads-ui start` | Web dashboard, kanban |
| bdui | `bdui` | Quick terminal view |
| perles | `perles` | BQL queries |
| beads.el | `M-x beads-list` | Emacs users |

## Time Tracking Configuration

Configure per-repo in `.aidevops.json`:

```json
{
  "time_tracking": "prompt",
  "features": ["planning", "time-tracking", "beads"]
}
```

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `true` | Always prompt for time at commit |
| `false` | Never prompt (disable time tracking) |
| `prompt` | Ask once per session, remember preference |

Use `/log-time-spent` command to manually log time anytime.

## Git Branch Strategy for TODO.md Changes

TODO.md changes fall into two categories with different branch strategies:

### Stay on Current Branch (Default)

Most TODO.md changes should stay on the current branch:

| Change Type | Example | Why Stay? |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Task discovered during work | "Found we need rate limiting while building auth" | Related context |
| Subtask additions | Adding t019.2.1 while working on t019 | Must stay together |
| Status updates | Moving task to In Progress, marking Done | Part of workflow |
| Dependency updates | Adding `blocked-by:` when discovering blockers | Discovered in context |
| Context notes | Adding notes to tasks you're actively working on | Preserves context |

### Consider Dedicated Worktree

When adding **unrelated backlog items** (new ideas, tools to evaluate, future work):

| Condition | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| TODO.md-only changes | Commit directly on main (no branch needed) |
| Mixed changes (TODO + code/agent files) | Create a worktree |
| Adding 3+ unrelated items on a feature branch | Suggest committing on main instead |

**Prompt pattern** (when adding unrelated backlog items from a feature branch):

```text
Adding {N} backlog items unrelated to `{current-branch}`:
- {item 1}
- {item 2}

1. Add to current branch (quick, may create PR noise)
2. Create worktree: `wt switch -c chore/backlog-updates` (cleaner history)
3. Add to main directly (TODO.md only, skip PR) — recommended for planning-only
```

**NEVER use `git checkout -b` in the main repo directory.** If a dedicated branch is needed, always use a worktree (`wt switch -c`).

### Why Not Always Switch?

An "always switch branches for TODO.md" rule fails the 80% universal applicability test:

- ~45% of todo additions ARE related to current work
- Worktree creation adds overhead per switch
- Context is lost when separating related discoveries

**Bottom line**: Use judgment. Related work stays together; unrelated TODO-only backlog goes directly to main; mixed changes use a worktree.

## Distributed Task Claiming (t164/t165)

**TODO.md is the master source of truth** for task ownership. Git platform issues (GitHub, GitLab) are a public interface for external contributors — they are bi-directionally synced but never authoritative over TODO.md.

**Claim flow:**

```bash
# Claim: add assignee:<identity> started:<ISO> to task line in TODO.md, sync to GH issue
# Unclaim: remove assignee: + started: fields, sync to GH issue
# The /full-loop command handles claiming automatically before starting work.
# Race protection: git push rejection = someone else claimed first — pull, re-check, abort.
```

**How it works:**

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Claim** | `git pull` → check `assignee:` in TODO.md → add `assignee:identity started:ISO` → `commit + push` → sync to GH issue |
| **Check** | `grep "assignee:"` on task line — instant, offline |
| **Unclaim** | Remove `assignee:` + `started:` → `commit + push` → sync to GH issue |
| **Race protection** | Git push rejection = someone else claimed first. Pull, re-check, abort. |

**Identity:** Set `AIDEVOPS_IDENTITY` env var, or defaults to `$(whoami)@$(hostname -s)`.

**Who claims:**

| Actor | Before work | During work | After work |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Supervisor** | `claim` before dispatch (auto) | Worker runs | Manual `unclaim` or task completion |
| **Human** | `claim` or add `assignee:name` manually | Edit code | PR merge, mark `[x]` |
| **Pre-edit check** | Warns if claimed by another | — | — |

**Bi-directional sync:** When `gh` CLI is available and the task has `ref:GH#`, claiming/unclaiming automatically syncs to GitHub Issue assignees and status labels. If someone assigns themselves on GitHub, `issue-sync pull` brings that back as `assignee:` in TODO.md. The sync is optional — claiming works fully offline with any git remote.

**Status labels** on GitHub Issues: `status:available` → `status:claimed` → `status:in-review` → `status:done`

## MANDATORY: Worker TODO.md Restriction

**Workers (headless dispatch runners) must NEVER edit TODO.md directly.** This is the primary cause of merge conflicts when multiple workers + supervisor all push to TODO.md on main simultaneously.

### Ownership model

| Actor | May edit TODO.md? | How they report status |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Supervisor** (cron pulse) | Yes (via `todo_commit_push()`) | Directly updates TODO.md |
| **Interactive user session** | Yes (via `planning-commit-helper.sh`) | Directly updates TODO.md |
| **Worker** (headless runner) | **NO** | Exit code + log output + mailbox |

### How workers report status

Workers communicate outcomes to the supervisor through:

1. **Exit code**: 0 = success, non-zero = failure
2. **Log output**: The supervisor reads worker logs to extract outcome details
3. **Mailbox**: `mail-helper.sh send` for structured status reports
4. **PR creation**: Workers create PRs; the supervisor detects PR URLs

The supervisor then updates TODO.md based on these signals during its pulse cycle.

### Why this matters

Without this restriction, the conflict pattern is:

```text
T+0:01  Supervisor pulse → update_todo_on_complete("t001") → push
T+0:01  Worker D (still running) → edits TODO.md → push → CONFLICT
T+0:02  Supervisor pulse → update_todo_on_complete("t002") → push
T+0:02  User session → /save-todo → push → CONFLICT
```

All TODO.md commit+push operations now use `todo_commit_push()` from `shared-constants.sh`, which provides flock-based locking and pull-rebase-retry. But the primary fix is preventing workers from writing to TODO.md at all.

## MANDATORY: Commit and Push After TODO Changes

After ANY edit to TODO.md, todo/PLANS.md, or todo/tasks/*, you MUST commit and push immediately. **This applies to interactive sessions and the supervisor only -- not workers.**

### Planning-only changes (on main)

Planning files (TODO.md, todo/) are allowed exceptions that can be edited directly on main. Use the helper script:

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/planning-commit-helper.sh "chore: add {description} to backlog"
```

No branch, no PR -- commit and push directly to main. The helper uses `todo_commit_push()` for serialized locking to prevent race conditions.

### Mixed changes (planning + non-exception files)

If the change also touches non-exception files (e.g., `.agents/workflows/plans.md`):

1. **Create a worktree**: `wt switch -c chore/todo-{slug}` (creates `~/Git/{repo}-chore-todo-{slug}/`)
2. **Make changes in the worktree directory**
3. **Commit, push, PR, merge** from the worktree
4. The main repo directory stays on `main` throughout

**NEVER use `git checkout -b` or `git stash` in the main repo directory.** The main repo must always stay on `main`.

### Why this matters

Uncommitted TODO changes are invisible to other sessions, agents, and the `/ready` command. They can be lost on branch switches or stash conflicts.

**Commit message conventions for TODO changes**:

| Change | Message |
|--------|---------|
| New backlog item | `chore: add t{NNN} {short description} to backlog` |
| Multiple items | `chore: add t{NNN}-t{NNN} backlog items` |
| Status update | `chore: update task t{NNN} status` |
| Plan creation | `chore: add plan for {title}` |

## GitHub Issue Sync

Tasks and GitHub issues MUST stay in sync with matching identifiers.

### Convention

- **GitHub issue titles** MUST be prefixed with their TODO.md task ID: `t{NNN}: {title}`
- **TODO.md tasks** MUST reference their GitHub issue: `ref:GH#{NNN}`
- Both directions must be maintained whenever either is created or updated

### When Creating a GitHub Issue

```bash
# Always prefix with t-number
gh issue create --title "t146: bug: supervisor no_pr retry counter non-functional" ...
```

### When Creating a TODO.md Task from an Issue

```markdown
- [ ] t146 bug: supervisor no_pr retry counter #bugfix ~15m logged:2026-02-07 ref:GH#439
```

### When Creating Both Together

1. Assign the next available t-number
2. Create the GitHub issue with `t{NNN}:` prefix in the title
3. Add the task to TODO.md with `ref:GH#{issue_number}`
4. Commit and push TODO.md immediately

### Automated Enforcement

The supervisor's `update_todo_on_complete()` and `send_task_notification()` functions should maintain this sync. When the supervisor creates issues or updates TODO.md, it must:

1. Check if a matching GitHub issue exists (search by `t{NNN}` in title)
2. If not, create one with the `t{NNN}:` prefix
3. If the TODO.md task lacks `ref:GH#`, add it after issue creation
4. When closing a task, close the matching GitHub issue with a comment

### Why This Matters

Without consistent t-number prefixes on issues, there's no way to:
- Quickly find the GitHub issue for a TODO.md task (or vice versa)
- Automate status sync between the two systems
- Track which issues correspond to which batch of work

## Integration with Other Workflows

| Workflow | Integration |
|----------|-------------|
| `git-workflow.md` | Branch names derived from tasks/plans |
| `branch.md` | Task 0.0 creates branch |
| `feature-development.md` | Auto-suggests planning for complex work |
| `preflight.md` | Run before marking plan complete |
| `changelog.md` | Update on plan completion |
